# About
Nestling bot was my passion project from the beginning of high school to the middle of Sophomore year. I still work on this bot occassionally, but development has mostly stopped for now. 
Working on this bot taught me how to use Pycord (fork of discord.py) very well. I learned how to:

- Create embeds
- Purge messages
- Send messages
- Create working slash commands
- Create parameters for those slash commands
- Create paramters in those slash commands that have autocomplete
- Create buttons
- Make views persistent
- Make selection menus
- Work with cogs and learn various ways to connect different project files together
- Use MongoDB
- Use SQLlite3 (for py)
- Work with a deployment environment and the problems that came with it
- Style for embeds and buttons
- Send images
- Send images from bytes
- Manipulate images with pillow & send them from bytes
- Reading various APIs like that one cat and dog image api
- Storing info in some other APIs like that one image host
- Create various games like 2048 and snake within discord (which was really fun)
- Verify my discord bot
- Create an application for certain intents in my discord bot
- Write a basic privacy policy for my application
- Write documentation for my application
- Secure keys by having to reset all of the keys before I made this whole repo public (you can technically still find my API keys in the repo but they're all invalid now. I now use env variables because they're more secure)

Although this was a solo project, it helped me become proficient before I moved on to bigger team projects with friends.
