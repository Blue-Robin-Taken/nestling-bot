 Thou Son of God, eternal Word, 
 Who heaven and earth's foundations laid, 
 Upholding by Thy word and pow'r 
 The universe Thy hands have made. 
 
  Refrain:  
 We worship Thee, all glorious Lord, 
 Forever be Thy name adored! 
 We worship Thee, all glorious Lord, 
 Forever be Thy name adored! 
 
 As Lamb of God, Thy path we view, 
 Thy Father's will Thy whole delight; 
 To Calvary we trace Thy way, 
 Each step of Thine, with glory bright; 
 
 For us Thine untold sufferings there, 
 For us the darkness and the woe, 
 In love, transcending all compare, 
 Thou, Lord, for us to death did'st go, 
 
 Exalted to the Father's throne, 
 With glory and with honor crowned, 
 All at Thy glorious name shall bow, 
 As Lord of all by each be owned.
