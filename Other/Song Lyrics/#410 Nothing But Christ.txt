 Nothing but Christ, as on we tread, 
 The Gift unpriced - God's living Bread, 
 With staff in hand and feet well shod, 
 Nothing but Christ - the Christ of God. 
 
 Everything loss for Him below, 
 Taking the cross where'er we go; 
 Showing to all, where once He trod, 
 Nothing but Christ - the Christ of God. 
 
 Nothing save Him, in all our ways, 
 Giving the theme for ceaseless praise; 
 Our whole resource along the road, 
 Nothing but Christ - the Christ of God.
