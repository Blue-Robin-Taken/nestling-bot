 Complete in Thee! No work of mine 
 May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine; 
 Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, 
 And I am now complete in Thee. 
 
  Refrain
Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
And sanctified! Salvation wrought!
Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
And glorified, I too, shall be!  
 
 Complete in Thee! No more shall sin, 
 Thy grace hath conquered, reign within; 
 Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee, 
 And I shall stand complete in Thee. 
 
 Complete in Thee - each want supplied, 
 And no good thing to me denied; 
 Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be, 
 I ask no more, complete in Thee. 
 
 Dear Savior! When before Thy bar 
 All tribes and tongues assembled are, 
 Among Thy chosen will I be, 
 At Thy right hand, complete in Thee.
