 Now in a song of grateful praise 
 To Christ, the Lord, our voice we'll raise; 
 With all Thy saints we'll join to tell: 
 Christ Jesus "hath done all things well!" 
 
 All worlds His glorious pow'r confess, 
 His wisdom all His works express; 
 But, O His love! - Our tongues would tell: 
 Christ Jesus "hath done all things well." 
 
 And since our souls have known His love, 
 What mercies has He made us prove; 
 Mercies which all our praise excel, 
 For Jesus "hath done all things well." 
 
 And when on that bright day we rise, 
 And join the anthems of the skies, 
 In heav'nly songs this note shall swell, 
 Christ Jesus "hath done all things well!"
