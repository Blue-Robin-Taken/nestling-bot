  The service of Jesus true pleasure affords, 
 In Him there is joy without an alloy; 
 'Tis heaven to trust Him and rest on His words; 
 It pays to serve Jesus each day. 
 
  Refrain:
It pays to serve Jesus, it pays ev'ry day,
It pays ev'ry step of the way;
(ev'ry step of the way;)
Though the pathway to glory may sometime be drear,
You'll be happy each step of the way.  
 
 It pays to serve Jesus what-e'er may betide, 
 It pays to be true what-e'er you may do; 
 'Tis riches of mercy in Him to abide; 
 It pays to serve Jesus each day. 
 
 Though sometimes the shadows may hang o'er the way, 
 And sorrows may come to beckon us home, 
 Our precious Redeemer each toil will repay; 
 It pays to serve Jesus each day.
