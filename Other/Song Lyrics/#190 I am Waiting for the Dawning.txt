 I am waiting for the dawning 
 Of the bright and blessed day, 
 When the dark-some night of sorrow 
 Shall have vanished far away; 
 When for ever with the Saviour, 
 Far beyond this vale of tears, 
 I shall swell the song of worship 
 Through the everlasting years. 
 
 I am looking at the brightness, 
 See, it shineth from afar, 
 Of the clear and joyous beaming 
 Of the "Bright and Morning Star." 
 Through the dark grey mist of morning 
 Do I see its glorious light; 
 Then away with every shadow 
 Of this sad and weary night. 
 
 I am waiting for the coming 
 Of the Lord who died for me; 
 O His words have thrilled my spirit, 
 "I will come again for thee." 
 I can almost hear His footfall 
 On the threshold of the door, 
 And my heart, my heart is longing 
 To be with Him evermore.
