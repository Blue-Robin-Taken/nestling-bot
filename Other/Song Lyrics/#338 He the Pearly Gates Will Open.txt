  Love divine, so great and wondrous, 
 Deep and mighty, pure, sublime; 
 Coming from the heart of Jesus - 
 Just the same through tests of time. 
 
  REFRAIN
He the pearly gates will open
So that I may enter in;
For He purchased my redemption
And forgave me all my sin.  
 
 Like a dove when hunted, frightened, 
 As a wounded fawn was I; 
 Broken-hearted, yet He healed me - 
 He will heed the sinner's cry. 
 
 Love divine, so great and wondrous - 
 All my sins He then forgave. 
 I will sing His praise forever 
 For His blood, His power to save. 
 
 In life's eventide, at twilight, 
 At His door I'll knock and wait; 
 By the precious love of Jesus, 
 I shall enter heaven's gate.
