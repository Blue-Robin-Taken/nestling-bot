 Christ is the Saviour of sinners, Christ is the Saviour for me; 
 Long I was chained in sin's darkness, Now by His grace I am free. 
 
  Refrain:
Saviour (Saviour) of sinners, Saviour of sinners like me,
Shedding His blood for my ransom, Christ is the Saviour for me.  
 
 Now I can say I am pardoned, Happy and justified free, 
 Saved by my blessed Redeemer, This is the Saviour for me. 
 
 Just as I was He received me. Seeking from judgement to flee, 
 Now there is no condemnation, This is the Saviour for me. 
 
 Soon shall the glory be dawning, Then His own face I shall see, 
 Sing, O my soul, in the gladness, This is the Saviour for me.
