 Join all the glorious names 
 Of wisdom, love and pow'r 
 That mortals ever knew, 
 That angels ever bore; 
 All are too mean to speak His worth, 
 Too mean to set the Savior forth. 
 
 Great Prophet of our God! 
 Our tongues must bless Thy name, 
 By whom the joyful news 
 Of free salvation came; 
 The joyful news of sins forgiv'n, 
 Of hell subdued, of peace with heav'n. 
 
 Thou art our Counselor, 
 Our Pattern and our Guide, 
 And Thou our Shepherd art; 
 Oh, keep us near Thy side; 
 Nor let our feet e'er turn astray, 
 To wander in the crooked way. 
 
 We love the Shepherd's voice; 
 His watchful eyes shall keep 
 Our pilgrim-souls among 
 The thousands of God's sheep; 
 He feeds His flock, He calls their names, 
 And gently leads the tender lambs.
