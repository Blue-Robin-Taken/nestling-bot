  [Recording forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 Grace! ’tis a charming sound, 
 Harmonious to the ear; 
 Heav’n with the echo shall resound, 
 And all the earth shall hear. 
 
  Refrain:
Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea:
Jesus died for all mankind, And Jesus died for me.  
 
 ’Twas grace that wrote my name 
 In life’s eternal book; 
 ’Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb, 
 Who all my sorrows took. 
 
 Grace taught my wandering feet 
 To tread the heav'nly road; 
 And new supplies each hour I meet 
 While pressing on to God. 
 
 Grace taught my heart to pray, 
 And made my eyes o’erflow; 
 ’Tis grace which kept me to this day, 
 And will not let me go. 
 
 Oh, let that grace inspire 
 My heart with strength divine; 
 May all my powers to Thee aspire, 
 And all my days be Thine.
