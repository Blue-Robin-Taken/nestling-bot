 For there is one God and one mediator 
 Between God and men, 
 For there is one God and one mediator, 
 The Man, Christ Jesus. 
 
 Who gave Himself a ransom for us all; 
 Who gave Himself a ransom for us all; 
 Who gave Himself a ransom for us all - 
 Oh, what a wonderful Saviour! 
 
 For there is one God and one mediator 
 Between God and men, 
 For there is one God and one mediator, 
 The Man, Christ Jesus.
