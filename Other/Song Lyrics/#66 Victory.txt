  O lead me to the Man that died, Who all God's nature glorified; 
 Descending to the depths of woe; And for us vanquished every foe! 
 
 O lead me to the empty tomb His death has robbed of all its gloom; 
 He's ris'n! the Lord of life and peace, And holds me in His fond embrace. 
 
 O lead me up to heaven's height, To see the Lord enthroned in light; 
 That gazing on His glory there, I may reflect His image here. 
 
 O lead me to that meeting rare, so often longed for in the air; 
 Then, then, His blessed face I'll see, And praise Him through eternity. 
 
 O lead me on to Zion's hill, To see the Lord His Word fulfil; 
 His glorious King is sitting there, Ruling o'er earth and sea and air. 
 
 O lead me to that scene sublime, Prepared by God before all time; 
 Sin, death, and night have passed away; Light, life, and love are there to stay. 
 
 There, too, the Eternal Three in One, Blest Father, Spirit and the Son, 
 Rest undisturbed forevermore; I wonder, worship, and adore!
