 O patient, spotless One! 
 our hearts in meekness train 
 To bear thy yoke and learn of Thee, 
 That we may rest obtain. 
 
 Savior! Thou art enough 
 The mind and heart to fill; 
 Thy life, to calm the anxious soul, 
 Thy love, its fear dispel 
 
 O fix our earnest gaze 
 So wholly, Lord on Thee, 
 That with Thy beauty occupied, 
 We else-where none may see.
