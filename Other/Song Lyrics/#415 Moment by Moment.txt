  Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine; 
 Living with Jesus, a new life divine; 
 Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine, 
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine. 
 
  Refrain:
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love;
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.  
 
 Never a trial that He is not there, 
 Never a burden that He doth not bear, 
 Never a sorrow that He doth not share, 
 Moment by moment, I'm under His care. 
 
 Never a heartache, and never a groan, 
 Never a teardrop, and never a moan; 
 Never a danger but there on the throne, 
 Moment by moment He thinks of His own. 
 
 Never a weakness that He doth not feel, 
 Never a sickness that He cannot heal; 
 Moment by moment, in woe or in weal, 
 Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
