  Day by day and with each passing moment, 
 Strength I find to meet my trials here; 
 Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment, 
 I've no cause for worry or for fear. 
 He whose heart is kind beyond all measure 
 Gives unto each day what He deems best– 
 Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, 
 Mingling toil with peace and rest. 
 
 Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me, 
 With a special mercy for each hour; 
 All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me, 
 He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r. 
 The protection of His child and treasure 
 Is a charge that on Himself He laid: 
 "As your days, your strength shall be in measure"– 
 This the pledge to me He made. 
 
 Help me then in ev'ry tribulation 
 So to trust your promises, O Lord, 
 That I lose not faith's sweet consolation 
 Offered me within Your holy Word. 
 Help me, Lord, when, toil and trouble meeting, 
 E'er to take, as from a father's hand, 
 One by one, the days, the moments fleeting, 
 Till I reach the promised land.
