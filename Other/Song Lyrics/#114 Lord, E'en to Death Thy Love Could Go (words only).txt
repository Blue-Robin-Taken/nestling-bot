  Lord, e'en to death Thy love could go, A death of shame and loss, 
 To vanquish for us ev'ry foe, And break the strong man's force. 
 
 Oh, what a load was Thine to bear, Alone in that dark hour, 
 Our sins in all their terror there, God's wrath and Satan's pow'r! 
 
 The storm that bowed Thy blessed head Is hushed forever now, 
 And rest divine is ours instead, Whilst glory crowns Thy brow. 
 
 Within the Father's house on high we soon shall sign Thy praise, 
 But here, where Thou didst bleed and die, we learn that song to raise.
