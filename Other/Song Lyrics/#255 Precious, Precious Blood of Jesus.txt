 Precious, precious blood of Jesus, Shed on Calvary, 
 Shed for rebels, and for sinners, Shed for me! 
 
 Precious blood that hath redeemed us, All the price is paid! 
 Perfect pardon now is offered, Peace is made. 
 
 Though thy sins are red like crimson, Deep in scarlet glow, 
 Jesus' precious blood can make them White as snow. 
 
 Precious, precious blood of Jesus, Ever offered free! 
 O believe it, O receive it, 'Tis for thee! 
 
 Precious blood, whose full atonement Makes us nigh to God! 
 Precious blood, our song and glory, Praise and laud!
