 Redeemed - how I love to proclaim it! 
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
 Redeemed through His infinite mercy, 
 His child, and forever, I am. 
 
  Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed, Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed, His child, and forever, I am.  
 
 Redeemed and so happy in Jesus, 
 No language my rapture can tell; 
 I know that the light of His presence 
 With me doth continually dwell. 
 
 I think of my blessed Redeemer, 
 I think of Him all the day long; 
 I sing, for I cannot be silent; 
 His love is the theme of my song. 
 
 I know I shall see in His beauty 
 The King in whose law I delight; 
 Who lovingly guardest my footsteps, 
 And givest me songs in the night.
