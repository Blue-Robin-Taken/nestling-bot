  Go, labor on; spend, and be spent – 
 Thy joy to do the Father’s will; 
 It is the way the Master went; 
 Should not the servant tread it still? 
 
 Go, labor on; ‘tis not for nought; 
 Thy earthly loss is heav’nly gain; 
 Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not; 
 The Master praises, - what are men? 
 
 Go, labor on while it is day, 
 The world’s dark night is hast’ning on; 
 Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away, 
 It is not thus that souls are won. 
 
 Men die in darkness at your side, 
 Without a hope to cheer the tomb; 
 Take up the torch and wave it wide- 
 The torch that lights time’s thickest gloom. 
 
 Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray; 
 Be wise the erring soul to win; 
 Go forth into the world’s highway, 
 Compel the wand’rer to come in. 
 
 Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice; 
 For toil comes rest, for exile home; 
 Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom‘s voice, 
 The midnight cry: “Behold, I come!“
