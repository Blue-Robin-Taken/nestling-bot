 I've a message from the Lord, Hallelujah! 
 The message unto you I'll give; 
 'Tis recorded in His word, Hallelujah! 
 It is only that you "look and live." 
 
  Refrain:
"Look and live," ("Look and live,")
O sinner live, ("Look and live,")
Look to Jesus now and live;
'Tis recorded in His word, Hallelujah!
It is only that you "look and live."  
 
 I've a message full of love, Hallelujah! 
 A message, O my friend for you; 
 'Tis a message from above, Hallelujah! 
 Jesus said it and I know 'tis true. 
 
 Life is offered unto you; Hallelujah! 
 Eternal life thy soul shall have, 
 If you'll only look to Him, Hallelujah! 
 Look to Jesus who alone can save. 
 
 I will tell you how I came, Hallelujah! 
 To Jesus when He made me whole; 
 'Twas believing on His name, Hallelujah! 
 I trusted and He saved my soul.
