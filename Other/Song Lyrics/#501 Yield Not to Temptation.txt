  Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin; 
 Each vict'ry will help you some other to win; 
 Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue, 
 Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through. 
 
  Refrain:  
 Ask the Saviour to help you, comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
 He is waiting to aid you, He will carry you through. 
 
 Shun evil companions, bad language disdain, 
 God's name hold in rev'rence, nor take it in vain; 
 Be thoughtful and earnest, kindhearted and true, 
 Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through. 
 
 To him that o'ercometh God giveth a crown, 
 Through faith we shall conquer, though often cast down; 
 He, who is our Saviour, our strength will renew, 
 Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.
