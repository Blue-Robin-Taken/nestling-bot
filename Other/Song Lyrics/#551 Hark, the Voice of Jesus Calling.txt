  Hark, the voice of Jesus calling, "Who will go and work today? 
 Fields are white, and harvests waiting, who will bear the sheaves away?" 
 Loud and long the Master calleth, rich reward He offers thee; 
 Who will answer, gladly saying, "Here am I; send me, send me"? 
 
 If you cannot cross the ocean and the heathen lands explore, 
 You can find the heathen nearer, you can help them at your door; 
 If you cannot give your thousands, you can give the widow's mite; 
 And the least you give for Jesus will be precious in His sight. 
 
 Let none hear you idly saying, "There is nothing I can do," 
 While the souls of men are dying, and the Master calls for you; 
 Gladly take the task He gives you; let His work your pleasure be; 
 Answer quickly when He calleth, "Here am I; send me, send me."
