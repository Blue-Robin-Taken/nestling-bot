 I was sinking deep in sin, Far from the peaceful shore, 
 Very deeply stained within, Sinking to rise no more; 
 But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry, 
 From the waters lifted me, Now safe am I. 
 
  Refrain:
Love lifted Me! (Even Me!), Love lifted Me! (Even Me!)
When nothing else could help, Love lifted me.  
 
 All my heart to Him I give, Ever to Him I'll cling, 
 In His blessed presence live, Ever His praises sing, 
 Love so might and so true merits my soul's bests songs; 
 Faithful, loving service, too, To Him belongs. 
 
 Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves; 
 He will lift you by His love out of the angry waves, 
 He's the Master of the sea, Billows His will obey; 
 He your Saviour wants to be - Be saved today.
