  There's a sweet and blessed story Of the Christ who came from glory, 
 Just to rescue me from sin and misery; 
 He in loving kindness sought me, And from sin and shame hath brought me, 
 Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me. 
 
  Refrain:
Hallelujah, what a Saviour! Who can take a poor sinner,
Lift him from the miry clay and set him free; (Hallelujah!)
I will ever tell the story, Shouting glory, glory, glory,
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.  
 
 From the depth of sin and sadness To the heights of joy and gladness 
 Jesus lifted me, in mercy full and free; 
 With His precious blood He bought me, When I knew Him not, He sought me, 
 And in love divine He ransomed me. 
 
 From the throne of heav'nly glory Oh the sweet and blessed story! 
 Jesus came to lift the lost in sin and woe 
 Into liberty all glorious, Trophies of His grace victorious, 
 Evermore rejoicing here below. 
 
 By and by with joy increasing, And with gratitude unceasing, 
 Lifted up with Christ forever more to be; 
 I will join the hosts there singing, In the anthem ever ringing, 
 To the King of Love who ransomed me.
