  I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord; 
 No tender voice like Thine can peace afford. 
 
  Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee;
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour,
I come to Thee!  
 
 I need Thee every hour, stay Thou near by; 
 Temptations lose their power when Thou art nigh. 
 
 I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain; 
 Come quickly and abide, or life is vain. 
 
 I need Thee every hour, most Holy One; 
 O make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son!
