 When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the Lord of glory died, 
 My richest gain I count but loss, 
 And pour contempt on all my pride. 
 
 Forbid it Lord, that I should boast, 
 Save in the cross of Christ my God; 
 All the vain things that charm me most, 
 I sacrifice them to His blood. 
 
 See, from His head, His hands, His feet, 
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 
 
 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
 That were an off'ring far too small; 
 Love so amazing, so divine, 
 Demands my heart, my life, my all!
