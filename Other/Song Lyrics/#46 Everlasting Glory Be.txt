 Everlasting glory be, 
 God and Father, unto Thee; 
 'Tis with joy Thy children raise 
 Hearts and voices in Thy praise. 
 Hearts and voices in Thy praise. 
 
 Thine the light that showed our sin, 
 Showed how guilty we had been; 
 Thine the love that freely gave, 
 Thine own Son our souls to save. 
 Thine own Son our souls to save. 
 
 Called to share the rest of God, 
 In the Father's blest abode; 
 God of love and God in light, 
 In Thy praises we unite. 
 In Thy praises we unite. 
 
 Gladly we Thy grace proclaim, 
 Knowing now the Father's name: 
 God and Father unto Thee 
 Everlasting glory be! 
 Everlasting glory be!
