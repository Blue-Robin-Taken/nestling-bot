 What Child is this, who, laid to rest,
 On Mary's lap is sleeping?
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
 While shepherds watch are keeping?

 Refrain:
 This, this is Christ, the King,
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
 The Babe, the Son of Mary!

 Why lies He in such mean estate,
 Where ox and ass are feeding?
 Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
 The silent Word is pleading.

 So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
 Come, peasant, king to own Him.
 The King of kings salvation brings;
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
