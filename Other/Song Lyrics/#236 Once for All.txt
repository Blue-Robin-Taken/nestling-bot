  Free from the law, O happy condition, 
 Jesus has bled and there is remission, 
 Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall, 
 Grace hath redeemed us once for all. 
 
  Refrain:
Once for all, O sinner, receive it,
Once for all, O brother, believe it;
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.  
 
 Now we are free, there's no condemnation, 
 Jesus provides a perfect salvation. 
 "Come unto Me," O hear His sweet call, 
 Come, and He saves us once for all. 
 
 "Children of God," O glorious calling, 
 Surely His grace will keep us from falling; 
 Passing from death to life at His call; 
 Blessed salvation once for all.
