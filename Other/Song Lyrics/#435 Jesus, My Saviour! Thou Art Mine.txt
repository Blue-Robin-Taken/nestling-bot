  Jesus, my Saviour! Thou art mine, 
 The Father's gift of love divine; 
 All Thou hast done, and all Thou art, 
 Are now the portion of my heart. 
 
 Poor, feeble, wretched, as I am, 
 I now can glory in Thy name; 
 Now cleansed in Thy most precious blood, 
 And made the righteousness of God. 
 
 All that Thou hast Thou hast for me, 
 All my fresh springs are hid in Thee; 
 In Thee I live; while I confess 
 I nothing am, yet all possess. 
 
 O Saviour, teach me to abide, 
 Close sheltered at Thy wounded side, 
 Each hour receiving grace, on grace, 
 Until I see Thee face to face.
