  Thou alone, Lord Jesus, canst true peace impart, 
 Thou dost know the sorrow of the human heart; 
 Thou who cam'st from glory here that heart to win, 
 And in love for sinners suffer'dst once for sin! 
 There is none, Lord Jesus, there is none like Thee, 
 For the broken-hearted there is none like Thee! 
 
 Hearts bowed down with sadness, laden with their sin, 
 Through Thy blood, Lord Jesus, boldly enter in; 
 Gladly hear Thee calling, "Come to Me and rest," 
 Lose their heavy burden on Thy loving breast. 
 There is none, Lord Jesus, there is none like Thee, 
 For the heavy-laden there is none like Thee! 
 
 Worldly joy is fleeting - vanity itself; 
 Vain the dazzling brightness, vain the stores of wealth; 
 Vain the pomp and glory; only Thou canst give 
 Peace and satisfaction whilst on earth we live. 
 There is none, Lord Jesus, there is none like Thee, 
 For the soul that thirsteth there is none like Thee!
