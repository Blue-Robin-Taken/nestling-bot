  The people of the Lord 
 Are on their way to heav'n; 
 They there obtain their great reward, 
 The prize will there be giv'n. 
 
 'Tis conflict here below, 
 'Tis triumph there, and peace,; 
 On earth we wrestle with the foe, 
 In heav'n our conflicts cease. 
 
 'Tis gloom and darkness here, 
 'Tis light and joy above; 
 There all is pure and all is clear, 
 There all is peace and love. 
 
 There rest shall follow toil, 
 And ease succeed to care; 
 The victors there divide the spoil, 
 They sing and triumph there. 
 
 Then let us joyful sing, 
 The conflict is not long; 
 We know in heav'n we'll praise our King 
 In one eternal song.
