 May the mind of Christ, my Saviour, 
 Live in me from day to day, 
 By His love and pow'r controlling 
 All I do and say. 
 
 May the Word of God dwell richly 
 In my heart from hour to hour, 
 So that all may see I triumph 
 Only through His pow'r. 
 
 May the peace of God my Father, 
 Rule my life in everything, 
 That I may be calm to comfort 
 Sick and sorrowing. 
 
 May the love of Jesus fill me, 
 As the waters fill the sea; 
 Him exalting, self abasing, 
 This is victory. 
 
 May I run the race before me, 
 Strong and brave to face the foe, 
 Looking only unto Jesus 
 As I onward go. 
 
 May His beauty rest upon me 
 As I seek the lost to win, 
 And may they forget the channel, 
 Seeing only Him.
