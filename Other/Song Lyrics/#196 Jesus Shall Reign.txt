  Jesus shall reign where'er the sun 
 Does his successive journeys run; 
 His kingdom spread from shore to shore, 
 Till moons shall wax and wane no more. 
 
 From north to south the princes meet 
 To pay their homage at His feet; 
 While western empires own their Lord, 
 And savage tribes attend His word. 
 
 To Him shall endless prayer be made, 
 And endless praises crown His head; 
 His name like sweet perfume shall rise 
 With every morning sacrifice. 
 
 People and realms of every tongue 
 Dwell on His love with sweetest song, 
 And infant voices shall proclaim 
 Their early blessings on His name.
