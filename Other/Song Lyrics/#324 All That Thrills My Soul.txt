  Who can cheer the heart like Jesus, 
 By His presence all divine? 
 True and tender, pure and precious, 
 O how blest to call Him Mine! 
 
  Refrain:
All that thrills my soul is Jesus;
He is more than life to me; (to me)
And the fairest of ten-thousand,
In my blessed Lord I see.  
 
 Love of Christ so freely given, 
 Grace of God beyond degree, 
 Mercy higher than the heaven, 
 Deeper than the deepest sea. 
 
 What a wonderful redemption! 
 Never can a mortal know 
 How my sin, tho' red like crimson, 
 Can be whiter than the snow. 
 
 Every need His hand supplying, 
 Every good in Him I see; 
 On His strength divine relying, 
 He is all in all to me. 
 
 By the crystal flowing river 
 With the ransomed I will sing, 
 And forever and forever 
 Praise and glorify the King.
