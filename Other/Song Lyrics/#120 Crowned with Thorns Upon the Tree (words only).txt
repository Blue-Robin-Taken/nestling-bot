  Crowned with thorns upon the tree, Silent in Thine agony; 
 Dying, crushed beneath the load Of the wrath and curse of God. 
 
 On Thy pale and suff’ring brow, Mystery of love and woe; 
 On Thy grief and sore amaze, Savior, I would fix my gaze! 
 
 On Thy holy, loving breast Thou dost bid the weary rest; 
 Rest there from the world’s false ways, Rest there from its vanities. 
 
 Rest in pardon and relief, From the load of guilt and grief; 
 Rest in Thy redeeming blood, Rest in perfect peace with God. 
 
 Sin-atoning Sacrifice, Thou art precious in mine eyes; 
 Thou alone my rest shall be, now and through eternity.
