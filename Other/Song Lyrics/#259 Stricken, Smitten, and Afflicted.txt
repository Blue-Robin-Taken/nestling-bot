  Stricken, smitten, and afflicted, 
 see Him dying on the tree! 
 'Tis the Christ by man rejected; 
 yes, my soul, 'tis He, 'tis He! 
 'Tis the long-expected Prophet, 
 David's Son, yet David's Lord; 
 by his Son God now has spoken: 
 'tis the true and faithful Word. 
 
 Tell me, ye who hear Him groaning, 
 was there ever grief like His? 
 Friends through fear His cause disowning, 
 foes insulting His distress; 
 many hands were raised to wound Him, 
 none would interpose to save; 
 but the deepest stroke that pierced Him 
 was the stroke that Justice gave. 
 
 Ye who think of sin but lightly 
 nor suppose the evil great 
 here may view its nature rightly, 
 here its guilt may estimate. 
 Mark the sacrifice appointed, 
 see who bears the awful load; 
 'tis the Word, the Lord's Anointed, 
 Son of Man and Son of God. 
 
 Here we have a firm foundation, 
 here the refuge of the lost; 
 Christ's the Rock of our salvation, 
 paid our debt at such a cost. 
 Lamb of God, for sinners wounded, 
 seated now in heaven above! 
 All our foes He has confounded 
 He now saves for He is love.
