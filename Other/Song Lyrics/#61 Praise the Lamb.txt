  Worthy, worthy is the Lamb - 
 Worthy, worthy is the Lamb - 
 Worthy, worthy is the Lamb - That was slain! 
 
  Chorus:
Praise Him, Hallelujah!
Bless Him, Hallelujah!
Praise Him, Hallelujah!
Praise the Lamb!  
 
 Thou redeemst our souls to God - 
 Thou redeemst our souls to God - 
 Thou redeemst our souls to God - By Thy blood. 
 
 Thou hast made us kings and priests - 
 Thou hast made us kings and priests - 
 Thou hast made us kings and priests - To our God. 
 
 We shall ever reign with Thee - 
 We shall ever reign with Thee - 
 We shall ever reign with Thee - Lamb of God.
