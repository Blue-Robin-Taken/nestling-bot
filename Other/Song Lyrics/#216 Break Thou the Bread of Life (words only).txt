  Break Thou the bread of life, Dear Lord to me, 
 As thou didst break the loaves beside the sea. 
 Beyond the sacred page I seek Thee Lord; 
 My spirit pants for Thee, O living word! 
 
 Break Thou the bread of life, O Lord, to me, 
 That hid within my heart Thy word may be: 
 Mould Thou each inward thought, from self set free, 
 And let my steps be all Controlled by Thee. 
 
 Open Thy word of truth, That I may see 
 Thy message written clear And plain for me; 
 Then in sweet fellowship walking with Thee, 
 Thine image on my life Engraved will be. 
 
 Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, To me, to me, 
 As thou didst bless the bread By Galilee: 
 Then shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall; 
 And I shall find my peace, My All in All!
