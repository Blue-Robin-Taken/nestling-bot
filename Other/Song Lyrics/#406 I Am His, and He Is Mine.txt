  Loved with everlasting love, 
 Led by grace that love to know; 
 Gracious Spirit from above, 
 Thou hast taught me it is so 
 O this full and perfect peace! 
 O this transport all divine! 
 In a love which cannot cease, I am His, and He is mine. 
 In a love which cannot cease, I am His, and He is mine. 
 
 Heav'n above is softer blue, 
 Earth around is sweeter green! 
 Something lives in every hue 
 Christless eyes have never seen; 
 Birds with gladder songs o'erflow, 
 flowers with deeper beauties shine, 
 Since I know, as now I know, I am His, and He is mine. 
 Since I know, as now I know, I am His, and He is mine. 
 
 Things that once were wild alarms 
 cannot now disturb my rest; 
 Closed in everlasting arms, 
 pillowed on the loving breast. 
 Oh, to lie forever here, 
 doubt and care and self resign, 
 While He whispers in my ear, I am His, and He is mine. 
 While He whispers in my ear, I am His, and He is mine. 
 
 His forever, only His; 
 Who the Lord and me shall part? 
 Ah, with what a rest of bliss 
 Christ can fill the loving heart! 
 Heav'n and earth may fade and flee, 
 firstborn light in gloom decline; 
 But while God and I shall be, I am His, and He is mine. 
 But while God and I shall be, I am His, and He is mine.
