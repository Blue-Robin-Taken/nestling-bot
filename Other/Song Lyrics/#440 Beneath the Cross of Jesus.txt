 Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand, 
 The shadow of a mighty Rock Within a weary land; 
 A home within the wilderness, A rest upon the way, 
 From the burning of the noontide heat And the burden of the day. 
 
 O safe and happy shelter! O refuge tried and sweet! 
 O trysting-place, where heaven's love And heaven's justice meet! 
 As to the pilgrim patriarch That wondrous dream was giv'n, 
 So seems my Savior's cross to me A ladder up to heav'n. 
 
 Upon the cross of Jesus, Mine eye at times can see 
 The very dying form of One Who suffered there for me; 
 And from my smitten heart with tears, Two wonders I confess, 
 The wonder of His glorious love, And my own worthlessness. 
 
 I take the cross of Jesus For my abiding place; 
 I ask no other sunshine than The sunshine of His face; 
 Content to let the world go by, To know no gain nor loss: 
 My sinful self my only shame, My glory all the cross.
