  In the land of fadeless day 
 Lies a "city four-square," 
 It shall never pass away, 
 And there is "no night there." 
 
  Refrain:
God shall "wipe away all tears;"
There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."  
 
 All the gates of pearl are made, 
 In the "city four-square," 
 All the streets with gold are laid, 
 And there is "no night there." 
 
 And the gates shall never close 
 To the "city four-square," 
 There life's crystal river flows, 
 And there is "no night there." 
 
 There they need no sunshine bright, 
 In that "city four-square," 
 For the Lamb is all the light, 
 And there is "no night there."
