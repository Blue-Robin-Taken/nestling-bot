 O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found, 
 And found in Thee alone, 
 The peace, the joy I sought so long, 
 The bliss till now unknown. 
 
  Refrain:
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other Name for me!
There's love, and life, and lasting joy,
Lord Jesus, found in Thee.  
 
 I sighed for rest and happiness, 
 I yearned for them, not Thee; 
 But, while I passed my Savior by, 
 His love laid hold on me. 
 
 I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, 
 But, ah, the waters failed; 
 Even as I stooped to drink they fled, 
 And mocked me as I wailed. 
 
 The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, 
 But never wept for Thee, 
 Till grace the sightless eyes received, 
 Thy loveliness to see.
