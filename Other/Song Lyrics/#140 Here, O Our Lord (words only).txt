  Here, O our Lord, we see Thee face to face; 
 Here would we touch and handle things unseen; 
 Here grasp with firmer hand th' eternal grace, 
 And all our weariness upon Thee lean. 
 
 Here would we feed upon the Bread of God, 
 Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n; 
 Here would we lay aside each earthly load, 
 Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n. 
 
 Too soon we rise:the symbols disappear; 
 The feast, tho' not the love is past and gone 
 The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here, 
 Nearer than ever, still our Shield and Sun. 
 
 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by, 
 Yet passing points to the glad feast above, 
 Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy, 
 The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
