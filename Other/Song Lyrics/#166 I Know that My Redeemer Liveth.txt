  I know that my Redeeemer liveth, 
 And on the earth again shall stand; 
 I know eternal life He giveth, 
 That grace and power are in His hand. 
 
  Refrain:  
 I know, I know that Jesus liveth, 
 And on the earth again shall stand; 
 I know, I know that life He giveth, 
 That grace and power are in His hand. 
 
 I know His promise never faileth 
 The word He speaks, it cannot die; 
 Though cruel death my flesh assaileth, 
 Yet I shall see Him by and by. 
 
 I know my mansion He prepareth, 
 That where He is there I may be; 
 O wondrous thought, for me He careth, 
 And He at last will come for me.
