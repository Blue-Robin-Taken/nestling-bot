  Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! 
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God, born of his Spirit, washed in His blood. 
 
  Refrain:  
 This is my story, this is my song, praising my Saviour all the day long; 
 This is my story, this is my song, praising my Saviour all the day long. 
 
 Perfect submission, perfect delight, visions of rapture now burst on my sight; 
 Angels descending, bring from above echoes of mercy, whispers of love. 
 
 Perfect submission, all is at rest, I in my Saviour am happy and blest; 
 Watching and waiting, looking above, filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
