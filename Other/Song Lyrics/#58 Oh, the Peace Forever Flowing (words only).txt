  [Recordings forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 Oh, the peace forever flowing From God's thoughts of His own Son! 
 Oh, the peace of simply knowing On the cross that all was done! 
 
 Peace with God! the blood in heaven Speaks of pardon now to me: 
 Peace with God! the Lord is risen! Righteousness now counts me free. 
 
 Peace with God is Christ in glory; God is just and God is love; 
 Jesus died to tell the story, Foes to bring to God above. 
 
 Now, free access to the Father, Through the Christ of God, we have; 
 By the Spirit here abiding, Promise of the Father's love. 
 
 Jesus, Savior, we adore Thee! Christ of God - Anointed Son! 
 We confess Thee, Lord of glory - Fruits of victory Thou hast won!
