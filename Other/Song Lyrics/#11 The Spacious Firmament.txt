  The spacious firmament on high, 
 With all the blue, ethereal sky, 
 And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
 Their great Original proclaim: 
 Th' unwearied sun, from day to day, 
 Does his Creator's power display; 
 And publishes to every land 
 The work of an almighty hand. 
 
 Soon as the evening shades prevail, 
 The moon takes up the wondrous tale; 
 And nightly, to the listening earth, 
 Repeats the story of her birth; 
 While all the stars that round her burn, 
 And all the planets in their turn, 
 Confirm the tidings as they roll, 
 And spread the truth from pole to pole. 
 
 What though, in solemn silence, all 
 Move round this dark terrestrial ball? 
 What though no real voice nor sound 
 Amid their radiant orbs be found? 
 In reason's ear they all rejoice, 
 And utter forth a glorious voice, 
 Forever singing as they shine, 
 "The hand that made us is divine."
