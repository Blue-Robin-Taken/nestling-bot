  Brightly beams our Father's mercy 
 From His lighthouse evermore, 
 But to us He gives the keeping 
 Of the lights along the shore. 
 
  Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
You may rescue, you may save.  
 
 Dark the night of sin has settled, 
 Loud the angry billows roar; 
 Eager eyes are watching, longing, 
 For the lights along the shore. 
 
 Trim your feeble lamp, my brother; 
 Some poor sailor tempest tossed, 
 Trying now to make the harbor, 
 In the darkness may be lost.
