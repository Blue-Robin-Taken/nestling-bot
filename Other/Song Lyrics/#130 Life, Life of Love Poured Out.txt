 Life, life of love poured out fragrant and holy! 
 Life, 'mid rude thorns of earth, stainless and sweet! 
 Life, whence God's face of love, glorious but lowly, 
 Shines forth to bow us, Lord, low at Thy feet! 
 
 Grief, grief of love that drew hate's ev'ry arrow! 
 Grief that Thy suff'ring heart only could meet! 
 Grief, whence Thy face of love, shining in sorrow, 
 Draws us, adoring, Lord, low at Thy feet! 
 
 Death, death of stricken love, wrath's sea exploring! 
 Death, Life's mysterious death - deep meeting deep! 
 Death, whence Thy bursting heart fills ours out-pouring 
 All, all in worship, Lord, low at Thy feet!
