  Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts in Christian love; 
 The fellowship of kindred minds Is like to that above. 
 
 Before our Fatherâ€™s throne, We pour our ardent prayers; 
 Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, Our comforts and our cares. 
 
 We share our mutual woes, Our mutual burdens bear; 
 And often for each other flows The sympathizing tear. 
 
 When we asunder part, It gives us inward pain; 
 But we shall still be joined in heart, And hope to meet again.
