  Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
 Ye soldiers of the cross; 
 Lift high His royal banner, 
 It must not suffer loss; 
 From vict'ry unto vict'ry 
 His army shall He lead, 
 Till ev'ry foe is vanquished 
 And Christ is Lord indeed. 
 
  Refrain:
Stand up for Jesus,
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not, it must not suffer loss.  
 
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
 The trumpet call obey; 
 Forth to the mighty conflict, 
 In this His glorious day; 
 "Ye that are men now serve Him" 
 Against unnumbered foes; 
 Let courage rise with danger, 
 And strength to strength oppose. 
 
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
 Stand in His strength alone; 
 The arm of flesh will fail you, 
 Ye dare not trust your own; 
 Put on the gospel armour, 
 Each piece put on with prayer; 
 Where duty calls or danger, 
 Be never wanting there. 
 
 Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
 The strife will not be long; 
 This day the noise of battle, 
 The next the victor's song; 
 To Him that overcometh, 
 A crown of life shall be; 
 He with the King of glory, 
 Shall reign eternally.
