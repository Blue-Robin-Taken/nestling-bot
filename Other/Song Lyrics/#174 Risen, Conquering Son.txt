  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son, 
 Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won; 
 Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away, 
 Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay. 
 
  Refrain:
Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won.  
 
 Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb; 
 Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom; 
 Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing, 
 For her Lord now liveth, death hast lost its sting. 
 
 No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of Life; 
 Life is nought without Thee: aid us in our strife; 
 Make us more than conqu'rors, thro' Thy deathless love; 
 Bring us safe thro' Jordan to Thy home above.
