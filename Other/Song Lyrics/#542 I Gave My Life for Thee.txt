  I gave My life for thee, My precious blood I shed, 
 That thou might'st ransomed be, And quickened from the dead; 
 I gave, I gave My life for thee, What hast thou given for Me? 
 I gave, I gave My life for thee, What hast thou given for Me? 
 
 My Father's house of light, My glory-circled throne 
 I left for earthly night, For wanderings sad and lone; 
 I left, I left it all for thee, Hast thou left aught for Me? 
 I left, I left it all for thee, Hast thou left aught for Me? 
 
 I suffered much for thee, More then thy tongue can tell, 
 Of bitterest agony, To rescue thee from hell; 
 I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, What hast thou borne for Me? 
 I've borne, I've borne it all for thee, What hast thou borne for Me? 
 
 And I have brought to thee, Down from My home above, 
 Salvation full and free, My pardon and My love; 
 I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee, What hast thou brought to Me? 
 I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee, What hast thou brought to Me?
