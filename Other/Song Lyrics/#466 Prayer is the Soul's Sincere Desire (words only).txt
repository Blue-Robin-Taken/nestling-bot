  Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 
 Uttered or unexpressed, 
 The motion of a hidden fire 
 That trembles in the breast. 
 
 Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 
 The falling of a tear, 
 The upward glancing of an eye 
 When none but God is near. 
 
 Prayer is the simplest form of speech 
 That infant lips can try; 
 Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach 
 The Majesty on high. 
 
 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 
 The Christian's native air; 
 His watchword at the gates of death: 
 He enters heavâ€™n with prayer 
 
 The saints, in prayer appear as one, 
 In word, and deed, and mind, 
 While with the Father and the Son, 
 Sweet fellowship they find. 
 
 O Thou by whom we come to God, 
 The life, the truth, the way! 
 The path of prayer Thyself hast trod: 
 Lord, teach us how to pray!
