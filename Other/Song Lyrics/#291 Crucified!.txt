  They nailed my Lord upon the tree 
 And left Him, dying, there; 
 Through love He suffered there for me; 
 'Twas love beyond compare. 
 
  Refrain:
Crucified! crucified! And nailed upon the tree!
With pierced hands and feet and side!
For you! (For you!) For me! (For me!)  
 
 Upon His head a crown of thorns, 
 Upon His heart my shame; 
 For me He prayed, for me He died, 
 And dying, spoke my name. 
 
 "Forgive them, O forgive!" He cried, 
 Then bowed His sacred head; 
 O Lamb of God! my sacrifice! 
 For me Thy blood was shed. 
 
 His voice I hear, His love I know; 
 I worship at His feet; 
 And kneeling there, at Calv'ry's cross, 
 Redemption is complete.
