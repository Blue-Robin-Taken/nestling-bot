  Christ the Lord is ris’n indeed, Hallelujah! 
 He has met His people's need, Hallelujah! 
 Borne their sins upon the cross, Hallelujah! 
 Suffered death and shame and loss, Hallelujah! 
 
 Yes, He took the bitter cup, Hallelujah! 
 To the dregs He drank it up; Hallelujah! 
 Gives the cup of blessing now, Hallelujah! 
 Worthy, Jesus, Lord, art Thou! Hallelujah! 
 
 Here He came from realms of light, Hallelujah! 
 Passed thro’ darkness, gloom and night, Hallelujah! 
 Fathomed all the depth of woe, Hallelujah! 
 Triumphed over every foe, Hallelujah! 
 
 God, that Holy One who gave, Hallelujah! 
 Could not leave Him in the grave, Hallelujah! 
 Raised Him to the highest height, Hallelujah! 
 Crowned Him there with glory bright, Hallelujah! 
 
 From the glory He will come, Hallelujah! 
 First to take His people home, Hallelujah! 
 Soon with them o’er death to reign, Hallelujah! 
 Come, Lord Jesus, come, Amen. Hallelujah!
