 Wounded for me, wounded for me, 
 There on the cross He was wounded for me; 
 Gone my transgressions, and now I am free, 
 All because Jesus was wounded for me. 
 
 Dying for me, dying for me, 
 There on the cross He was dying for me; 
 Now in His death my redemption I see, 
 All because Jesus was dying for me. 
 
 Risen for me, risen for me, 
 Up from the grave He was risen for me; 
 Now evermore from death's sting I am free, 
 All because Jesus has risen for me. 
 
 Living for me, living for me, 
 Up in the skies He is living for me; 
 Daily He's pleading and praying for me, 
 All because Jesus is living for me. 
 
 Coming for me, coming for me, 
 One day to earth He is coming for me; 
 Then with what joy His dear face I shall see, 
 Oh, how I praise Him! He's coming for me.
