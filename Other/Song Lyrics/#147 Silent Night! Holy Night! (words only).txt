  Silent night, holy night! 
 All is calm, all is bright 
 'Round yon virgin mother and child. 
 Holy Infant so tender and mild, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace. 
 
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Shepherds quake at the sight; 
 Glories stream from heaven afar; 
 Heav'nly hosts sing "alleluia! 
 Christ, the Savior, is born! 
 Christ, the Savior, is born!" 
 
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Son of God, love's pure light 
 Radiant beams from thy holy face, 
 With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. 
 
 Silent night, holy night 
 All is dark save the light 
 Yonder, where they sweet vigils keep,m 
 O'er the Babe who in silent sleep 
 Rests in heavenly peace, 
 Rest in heavenly peace.
