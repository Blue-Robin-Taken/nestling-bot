 A mind at perfect peace with God: 
 Oh, what a word is this! 
 A sinner reconciled through blood: 
 This, this indeed is peace. 
 
 By nature and by practice far, 
 How very far from God! 
 Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him 
 Through faith in Jesus' blood. 
 
 So near, so very near to God, 
 I cannot nearer be; 
 For in the person of His Son, 
 I am as near as He. 
 
 So dear, so very dear to God, 
 More dear I cannot be; 
 The love wherewith He loves the Son, 
 Such is His love to me. 
 
 Why should I ever careful be 
 Since such a God is mine? 
 He watches o'er me night and day, 
 And tells me, "Mine is thine".
