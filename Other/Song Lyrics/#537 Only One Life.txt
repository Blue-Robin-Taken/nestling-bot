  Only one life to offer - Jesus, my Lord and King; 
 Only on tongue to praise Thee And of Thy mercy sing (forever); 
 Only one heart's devotion - Savior, O may it be 
 Consecrated alone to Thy matchless glory, 
 Yielded fully to Thee. 
 
 Only this hour is mine, Lord - May it be used for Thee; 
 May ev'ry passing moment Count for eternity (my Saviour); 
 Souls all about are dying, Dying in sin and shame; 
 Help me bring them the message of Calv'ry's redemption 
 In Thy glorious name. 
 
 Only one life to offer - Take it, dear Lord, I pray; 
 Nothing from Thee withholding, Thy will I now obey (my Jesus); 
 Thou who hast freely given Thine all in all for me, 
 Claim this life for Thine own, to be used, my Saviour, 
 Ev'ry moment for Thee.
