  What rich eternal bursts of praise 
 Shall fill yon courts thro' endless days, 
 When time shall cease to be! 
 Around that throne the notes shall swell, 
 As each redeemed one joins to tell 
 Thy love, so vast and free! 
 
 Each shall the Savior's likeness bear, 
 A royal crown each brow shall wear, 
 With robes unsullied white, 
 The everlasting song shall be, 
 To Thee, O Lamb of God, to Thee, 
 'Mid scenes of purest light. 
 
 Our joy unhindered then with Thee, 
 Our eyes undimmed Thy glory see, 
 Whilst worthy praise we give, 
 Through that eternal cloudless day, 
 Our burning hearts with rapture say, 
 He died that we might live.
