 How good is the God we adore, 
 Our faithful, unchangeable Friend: 
 Whose love is as great as His pow'r, 
 And knows neither measure nor end. 
 
 'Tis Jesus the First and the Last, 
 Whose Spirit shall guide us safe home: 
 We'll praise Him for all that is past, 
 And trust Him for all that's to come.
