 Oh, what a Saviour, that He died for me! 
 From condemnation He hath made me free; 
 "He that believeth on the Son," saith He, 
 "Hath everlasting life." 
 
  Refrain:
"Verily, verily, I say unto you,"
"Verily, verily," message ever new;
"He that believeth on the Son," 'tis true,
"Hath everlasting life."  
 
 All my iniquities on Him were laid, 
 All my indebtedness by Him was paid; 
 All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said, 
 "Hath everlasting life." 
 
 Though poor and needy I can trust my Lord, 
 Though weak and sinful I believe His Word; 
 Oh, glad message! every child of God 
 "Hath everlasting life." 
 
 Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt, 
 For him that cometh, He will not cast our; 
 "He that believeth," oh, the good news shout, 
 "Hath everlasting life!"
