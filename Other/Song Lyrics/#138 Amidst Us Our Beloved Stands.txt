 Amidst us our Beloved stands, 
 And bids us view His pierced hands; 
 Points to the wounded feet and side, 
 Blest emblems of the Crucified. 
 
 What food luxurious loads the board, 
 When, at His table, sits the Lord! 
 The wine how rich, the bread how sweet, 
 When Jesus deigns the guests to meet! 
 
 If now, with eyes defiled and dim, 
 We see the signs, but see not Him; 
 O, may His love the scales displace, 
 And bid us see Him face to face! 
 
 Thou glorious Bridegroom of our hearts, 
 Thy present smile a heav'n imparts! 
 O, lift the veil, if veil there be, 
 Let ev'ry saint Thy glory see!
