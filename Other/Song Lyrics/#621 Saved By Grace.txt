  Some day the silver cord will break, 
 And I no more as now shall sing; 
 But, oh, the joy when I shall wake 
 Within the palace of the King! 
 
  Refrain  
 And I shall see Him face to face, 
 And tell the story - saved by grace; 
 And I shall see Him face to face, 
 And tell the story - saved by grace. 
 
 Some day my earthly house will fall, 
 I cannot tell how soon 'twill be; 
 But this I know - my All in All 
 Has now a place in heav'n for me. 
 
 Some day, when fades the golden sun 
 Beneath the rosy-tinted west, 
 My blessed Lord will say, "Well done!" 
 And I shall enter into rest. 
 
 Some day: till then I'll watch and wait, 
 My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, 
 That when my Saviour opes the gate, 
 My soul to Him make take its flight.
