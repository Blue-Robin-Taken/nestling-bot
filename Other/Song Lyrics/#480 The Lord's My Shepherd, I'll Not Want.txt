  The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want; 
 He makes me down to lie 
 In pastures green; He leadeth me 
 The quiet waters by. 
 
 My soul He doth restore again; 
 And me to walk doth make 
 Within the paths of righteousness, 
 E'en for His own name's sake. 
 
 Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale, 
 Yet will I fear no ill; 
 For Thou art with me, and Thy rod 
 And staff me comfort still. 
 
 My table Thou hast furnished 
 In presence of my foes; 
 My head Thou dost with oil anoint, 
 And my cup overflows. 
 
 Goodness and mercy all my life 
 Shall surely follow me; 
 And in God's house forevermore 
 My dwelling place shall be.
