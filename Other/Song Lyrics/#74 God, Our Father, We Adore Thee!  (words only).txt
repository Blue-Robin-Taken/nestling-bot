  God, our Father, we adore Thee! We, Thy children, bless Thy name! 
 Chosen in the Christ before Thee, we are “holy without blame.“ 
 We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Abba’s praises we proclaim! 
 We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Abba’s praises we proclaim! 
 
 Son, Eternal, we adore Thee! Lamb upon the throne on high! 
 Lamb of God, we bow before Thee,- Thou has brought Thy people nigh! 
 We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Son of God, who came to die! 
 We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Son of God, who came to die! 
 
 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – Three in One! We give Thee praise! 
 For the riches we inherit, heart and voice to Thee we raise! 
 We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Thee we bless, through endless days! 
 We adore Thee! We adore Thee! Thee we bless, throught endless days!
