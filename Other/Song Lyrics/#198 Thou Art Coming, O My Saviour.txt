  Thou art coming, O my Saviour, 
 Thou art coming, O my King, 
 In Thy beauty all resplendent, 
 In Thy glory all-transcendent; 
 Well may we rejoice and sing; 
 Coming - in the opening east 
 Herald brightness slowly swells; 
 Coming - O my glorious Priest, 
 Hear we not Thy golden bells? 
 
 Thou art coming, Thou art coming - 
 We shall meet Thee on Thy way, 
 We shall see Thee, we shall know Thee, 
 We shall bless Thee, we shall show Thee 
 All our hearts could never say, 
 What an anthem that will be, 
 Ringing out our love to Thee, 
 Pouring out our rapture sweet 
 At Thine own all glorious feet. 
 
 Thou art coming - at Thy table 
 We are witnesses for this; 
 While remembering hearts Thou meetest 
 In communion clearest, sweetest, 
 Earnest of our coming bliss; 
 Showing not Thy death alone, 
 And Thy love exceeding great, 
 But Thy coming, and Thy throne - 
 All for which we long and wait. 
 
 Thou art coming - we are waiting 
 With a hope that cannot fail, 
 Asking not the day or hour, 
 Resting on Thy word of power, 
 Anchored safe within the veil. 
 Time appointed may be long, 
 But the vision must be sure; 
 Certainty shall make us strong; 
 Joyful patience can endure. 
 
 Oh, the joy to see Thee reigning - 
 Thee, my own beloved Lord! 
 Every tongue Thy name confessing; 
 Worship, honor, glory, blessing 
 Brought to Thee with one accord - 
 Thee, my Master and my Friend, 
 Vindicated and enthroned, 
 Unto earthï¿½s remotest end 
 Glorified, adored, and owned!
