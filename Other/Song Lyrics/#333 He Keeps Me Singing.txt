  There's within my heart a melody, 
 Jesus whispers sweet and low, 
 Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still, 
 In all of life's ebb and flow. 
 
 REFRAIN  
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus---
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my every longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.  
 
 All my life was wrecked by sin and strife, 
 Discord filled my heart with pain, 
 Jesus swept across the broken strings, 
 Stirred the slumbering chords again. 
 
 Feasting on the riches of His grace, 
 Resting 'neath His sheltering wing, 
 Always looking on His smiling face, 
 That is why I shout and sing. 
 
 Soon He's coming back to welcome me 
 Far beyond the starry sky; 
 I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown, 
 I shall reign with Him on high.
