  My God, how wonderful Thou art, Thy majesty how bright, 
 How beautiful Thy mercyseat, In depths of burning light! 
 
 How wonderful, how beautiful The sight of Thee must be 
 Thine endless wisdom, boundless pow'r, And awesome purity! 
 
 Yet I may love Thee, too, O Lord, Almighty as Thou art, 
 For Thou hast stooped to ask of me The love of my poor heart. 
 
 Father of Jesus, love's reward, What rapture will it be 
 Prostrate before Thy throne to lie, And gaze, and gaze on Thee.
