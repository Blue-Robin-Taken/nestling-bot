 Jesus, before Thy face we fall - 
 Our Lord, our life, our hope, our all! 
 For we have nowhere else to flee - 
 No sanctuary, Lord, but Thee! 
 
 In Thee we every glory view, 
 Of safety, strength and beauty too: 
 'Tis all our rest and peace to see 
 Our sanctuary, Lord, in Thee! 
 
 Whatever foes or fears betide, 
 In Thy blest presence we may hide; 
 And while we rest our souls on Thee, 
 Thou wilt our Sanctuary be! 
 
 Through time with all its changing scenes, 
 Through all the grief that intervenes, 
 This shall support each fainting heart - 
 That Thou our Sanctuary art!
