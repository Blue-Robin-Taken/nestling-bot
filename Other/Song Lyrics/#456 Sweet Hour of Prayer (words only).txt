  Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of pray’r, 
 That calls me from a world of care, 
 And bids me at my Father's throne, 
 Make all my wants and wishes known. 
 In seasons of distress and grief 
 My soul has often found relief; 
 And oft escaped the tempter's snare, 
 By thy return, sweet hour of pray’r. 
 
 Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of pray’r, 
 The joy I feel, the bliss I share, 
 Of those whose anxious spirits burn 
 With strong desires for Thy return! 
 With such I hasten to the place 
 Where God, my Savior, shows His face, 
 And gladly take my station there, 
 And wait for thee, sweet hour of pray’r. 
 
 Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of pray’r, 
 Thy wings shall my petition bear 
 To Him whose truth and faithfulness 
 Engage the waiting soul to bless; 
 And since He bids me seek His face, 
 Believe His word, and trust His grace, 
 I'll cast on Him my every care, 
 And wait for thee sweet hour of pray’r.
