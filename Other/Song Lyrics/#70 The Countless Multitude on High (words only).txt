  The countless multitude on high, That tune their songs to Jesus’ name, 
 All merit of their own deny, And Jesus’ worth alone proclaim. 
 Firm on the ground of sov’reign grace, They stand before Jehovah's throne; 
 The only song in that blest place Is, “Thou art worthy! Thou alone!“ 
 
 With spotless robes of purest white, And branches of triumphal palm, 
 They shout, with transports of delight, Heav’n’s ceaseless, universal psalm: 
 “Salvation’s glory all be paid To Him who sits upon the throne, 
 And to the Lamb whose blood was shed; Thou! Thou art worthy! Thou alone! 
 
 “For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood These robes were washed so spotless pure; 
 Thou mad’st us kings and priests to God, For ever let Thy praise endure." 
 Let us with joy adopt the strain We soon shall sing forever there: 
 “Worthy’s the Lamb for sinners slain, Worthy alone the crown to wear!"
