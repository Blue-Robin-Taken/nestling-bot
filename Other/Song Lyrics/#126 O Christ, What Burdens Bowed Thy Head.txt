 O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head! Our load was laid on Thee; 
 Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead - To bear all ill for me. 
 A Victim led, Thy blood was shed; Now there's no load for me. 
 
 Death and the curse were in our cup - O Christ, 'twas full for Thee! 
 But Thou hast drained the last dark drop, 'Tis empty now for me. 
 That bitter cup - love drank it up; Left but the love for me. 
 
 Jehovah lifted up His rod - O Christ, it fell on Thee! 
 Thou was sore stricken of Thy God; There's not one stroke for me. 
 Thy blood beneath that rod has flowed: Thy bruising healeth me. 
 
 The tempest's awful voice was heard, O Christ, it broke on Thee; 
 Thy open bosom was my ward; It bore the storm for me. 
 Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred; Now cloudless peace for me. 
 
 For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died, And I have died in Thee; 
 Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied, And now Thou liv'st in me. 
 The Father's face of radiant grace Shine now in light on me!
