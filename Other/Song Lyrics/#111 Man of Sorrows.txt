 "Man of Sorrows," what a name 
 For the Son of God who came 
 Ruined sinners to reclaim! 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour! 
 
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
 In my place condemned He stood; 
 Sealed my pardon with His blood; 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour! 
 
 Guilty, vile and helpless we; 
 Spotless Lamb of God was He; 
 "Full atonement" can it be? 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour! 
 
 Lifted up was He to die, 
 "It is finished," was His cry; 
 Now in heaven exalted high; 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour! 
 
 When He comes, our glorious King, 
 All His ransomed home to bring, 
 Then anew this song we'll sing: 
 Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
