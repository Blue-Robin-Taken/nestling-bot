  More love to Thee, O Christ, 
 More love to Thee 
 Hear Thou the prayer I make 
 on bended knee 
 This is my earnest plea: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 
 Once earthly joy I craved, 
 Sought peace and rest 
 Now Thee alone I seek, 
 give what is best 
 This all my prayer shall be: 
 more love, O Christ, to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 
 Let sorrow do its work 
 Send grief and pain; 
 Sweet are Thy messengers, 
 Sweet their refrain, 
 When they can sing with me: 
 More love, O Christ to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee! 
 
 Then shall my latest breath 
 Whisper Thy praise 
 This be the parting cry 
 my heart shall raise 
 This still its prayer shall be: 
 more love, O Christ, to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee
