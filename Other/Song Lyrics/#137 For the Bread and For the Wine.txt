  For the bread and for the wine, For the pledge that seals Him mine, 
 For the words of love divine, We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
 
 Only bread and only wine, Yet to faith the solemn sign 
 Of the heav’nly and divine! We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
 
 For the words that turn our eye To the cross of Calvary, 
 Bidding us in faith draw nigh, We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
 
 For the words that tell of home, Pointing us beyond the tomb, 
 “Do ye this, until I come!” We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
 
 Till He come we take the bread, Type of Him on whom we feed, 
 Him who liveth and was dead! We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
 
 Till He come we take the cup; As we at His table sup, 
 Eye and heart are lifted up! We give Thee thanks, O Lord. 
 
 For that coming, here foreshown, For that day to man unknown, 
 For the glory and the throne, We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
