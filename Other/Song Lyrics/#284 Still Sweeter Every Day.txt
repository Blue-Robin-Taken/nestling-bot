 To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn; 
 He's fairer than the glory of the golden and purple dawn; 
 He's all my fancy pictures in its fairest dreams, and more; 
 Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before. 
 
  Refrain:
The half ... cannotbe fancied ... this
(The half cannot be fancied on this side the golden shore,)
side... the golden shore; ... Oh,
(The half cannot be fancied on this side the golden shore;)
there ... He'll be still sweeter
(oh there He'll be still sweeter than He ever was before)
than He ever was before  
 
 His glory broke upon me when I saw Him from afar; 
 He's fairer than the lily, brighter than the morning star; 
 He fills and satisfies my longing spirit o'er and o'er; 
 Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before. 
 
 My heart is sometimes heavy, but He comes with sweet relief; 
 He folds me to His bosom when I droop with blighting grief; 
 I love the Christ who all my burdens in His body bore; 
 Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.
