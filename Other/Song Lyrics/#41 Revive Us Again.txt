  We praise Thee, O God! 
 For the Son of Thy love, 
 For Jesus Who died, 
 And is now gone above. 
 
  Refrain:
Hallelujah! Thine the glory.
Hallelujah! Amen.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory.
Revive us again.  
 
 We praise Thee, O God! 
 For Thy Spirit of light, 
 Who hath shown us our Savior, 
 And scattered our night. 
 
 All glory and praise 
 To the Lamb that was slain, 
 Who hath borne all our sins, 
 And hath cleansed every stain. 
 
 All glory and praise 
 To the God of all grace, 
 Who hast brought us, and sought us, 
 And guided our ways.
