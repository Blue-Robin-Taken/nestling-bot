  He comes, Emmanuel comes! Jesus the crucified! 
 The Man of sorrows - He Who bow'd His head and died; 
 He hath redeem'd us by His blood: He comes to take us home to God. 
 
 He comes! Our Advocate, Who bears us on His breast; 
 Himself to take us home to His eternal rest: 
 Oh, let the hope dispel each fear - Our great High Priest will soon appear. 
 
 He comes! Our Shepherd comes, Whose eyelids never sleep: 
 To gather in the skies The thousands of His sheep; 
 Where the eternal fountains spring, Of love divine, His flock He'll bring. 
 
 He comes! The Heir of all! All shall His power obey: 
 Our Bridegroom to His Church His glories shall display: 
 But Oh! His love, what tongue can tell, Eternal, vast, unsearchable! 
 
 "Behold, I quickly come!" Responsive to Thy word, 
 The Spirit and the Bride Cry "Even so, O Lord!" 
 Naught else can satisfy her heart, But to be with Thee where Thou art.
