  [Recordings forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 Hail, Thou once despised Jesus! Hail, Thou still rejected King! 
 Thou didst suffer to release us, Thou didst free salvation bring; 
 Through Thy death and resurrection, Bearer of our sin and shame! 
 We enjoy divine protection, Life and glory through Thy name. 
 
 Paschal Lamb, by God appointed, All our sins on Thee were lad; 
 By our Father's love anointed, Thou hast full atonement made: 
 All who trust Thee are forgiven Through the virtue of Thy blood; 
 Rent in Thee the veil of heaven,Grace shines forth to man from God. 
 
 Savior, hail! amid the glory, Where for us Thou dost abide; 
 We, by faith do now adore Thee, Seated at Thy Father's side. 
 There, for us Thou now art pleading, While Thou dost our place prepare; 
 For Thy saints still interceding, Till in glory we appear. 
 
 Worship, honor, praise and blessing, Thou shalt then from all receive; 
 Loudest praises, without ceasing, All that earth or heav'n can give: 
 In that day Thy saints will meet Thee, Welcome Thee with grateful song; 
 Joyful hearts will ever greet Thee, Source of joy to all the throng!
