 I hear the Saviour say, 
 "Thy strength indeed is small, 
 Come to me I'll be thy stay, 
 Find in Me thine all in all." 
 
  Refrain:
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.  
 
 Lord, now indeed I find 
 Thy power, and Thine alone, 
 Can change the leper's spots, 
 And melt the heart of stone. 
 
 For nothing good have I 
 Whereby Thy grace to claim - 
 I'll wash my garments white 
 In the blood of Calvary's Lamb. 
 
 And when, before the throne, 
 I stand in Him complete, 
 "Jesus died my soul to save," 
 My lips shall still repeat.
