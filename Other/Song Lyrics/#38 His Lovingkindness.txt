 Awake, my soul, to joyful lays, And sing thy great Redeemer's praise; 
 He justly claims a song from me, His lovingkindness, oh, how free! 
 Lovingkindness, loving kindness, His lovingkindness, oh, how free! 
 
 He saw me ruined by the fall, Yet loved me notwithstanding all; 
 He saved me from my lost estate, His lovingkindness, oh, how great! 
 Lovingkindness, loving kindness, His lovingkindness, oh, how great! 
 
 When trouble, like a gloomy cloud, Has gathered thick and thundered loud, 
 He near my soul has always stood, His lovingkindness, oh, how good! 
 Lovingkindness, loving kindness, His lovingkindness, oh, how good! 
 
 Soon shall we mount and soar away To the bright realms of endless day, 
 And sing, with rapture and surprise, His lovingkindness, in the skies! 
 Lovingkindness, loving kindness, His lovingkindness, in the skies!
