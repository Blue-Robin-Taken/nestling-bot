  O Blessed, living Lord 
 Engage our heart with Thee, 
 And strike within the answering chord 
 To love so rich and free. 
 
 To know Thy loving heart, 
 And cleave to Thy blest side, 
 And gaze upon Thee where Thou art, 
 And in Thy love abide. 
 
 Be this our one desire, 
 Thyself our object here, 
 The goal to which our hearts aspire, 
 To meet Thee in the air.
