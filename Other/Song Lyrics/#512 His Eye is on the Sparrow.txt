 Why should I feel discouraged, Why should the shadows come, 
 Why should my heart be lonely And long for heav'n and home, 
 When Jesus is my portion? My constant Friend is He. 
 His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; 
 His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me. 
 
  Refrain:
I sing because I'm happy (I'm happy), I sing because I'm free (I'm free),
For His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me.  
 
 "Let not your heart be troubled," His tender word I hear, 
 And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears; 
 Thoough by the path He leadeth But one step I may see. 
 His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; 
 His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me. 
 
 Whenever I am tempted, Whenever clouds arise, 
 When songs give place to sighing, When hope within me dies, 
 I draw the closer to Him, From care He sets me free. 
 His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me; 
 His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He cares for me.
