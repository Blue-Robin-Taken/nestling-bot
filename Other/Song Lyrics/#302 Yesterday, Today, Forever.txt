  O how sweet the glorious message Simple faith may claim: 
 Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same! 
 Still He loves to save the sinful, Heal the sick and lame, 
 Cheer the mourner, calm the tempest - 
 Glory to His name! 
 
  Refrain:
Yesterday, today, forever,Jesus is the same;
All may change, but Jesus never - Glory to His name!
Glory to His name, Glory to His name:
All may change, but Jesus never - Glory to His name!  
 
 He who pardoned erring Peter Never need'st thou fear, 
 He who came to faithless Thomas All thy doubt will clear; 
 He who let the loved disciple On His bosom rest 
 Bids thee still, with love as tender, 
 Lean upon His breast. 
 
 He who 'mid the raging billows Walked upon the sea 
 Still can hush our wildest tempest, As on Galilee; 
 He who wept and prayed in anguish In Gethsemane 
 Drinks with us each cup of trembling 
 In our agony. 
 
 As of old He walked to Emmaus, With them to abide, 
 So thru all life's way He walketh Ever near our side; 
 Soon again shall we behold Him - Hasten Lord, the day! 
 But 'twill still be "this same Jesus," 
 As He went away.
