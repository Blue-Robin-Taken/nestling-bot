  Come, Thou Almighty King, 
 Help us Thy name to sing, 
 Help us to praise: 
 Father! All glorious, 
 O'er all victorious, 
 Come, and reign over us, 
 Ancient of Days. 
 
 Come, Thou Incarnate Word, 
 Gird on Thy mighty sword, 
 Our prayer attend! 
 Come, and Thy people bless, 
 And give Thy word success: 
 On thine faithfulness 
 We now depend. 
 
 Come, Holy Comforter, 
 Thy sacred witness bear, 
 In this glad hour! 
 Thou, who almighty art, 
 Now rule in ev'ry heart 
 To us Thy word impart 
 Spirit of pow'r. 
 
 To Thee, great One in Three, 
 The highest praises be, 
 Hence evermore; 
 His sovereign majesty 
 May we in glory see, 
 And to eternity 
 Love and adore.
