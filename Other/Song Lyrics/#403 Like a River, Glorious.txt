 Like a river, glorious Is God's perfect peace, 
 Over all victorious In its bright increase; 
 Perfect, yet it floweth Fuller ev'ry day; 
 Perfect, yet it groweth Deeper all the way. 
 
  Refrain:
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest:
Finding, as He promised, Perfect peace and rest.  
 
 Hidden in the hollow Of His blessed hand, 
 Never foe can follow, Never traitor stand; 
 Not a surge of worry, Not a shade of care, 
 Not a blast of hurry, Touch the spirit there. 
 
 Ev'ry joy or trial Falleth from above, 
 Traced upon our dial By the Sun of Love. 
 We may trust Him fully All for us to do; 
 They who trust Him wholly Find Him wholly true.
