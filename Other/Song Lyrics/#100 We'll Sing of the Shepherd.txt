 We'll sing of the Shepherd that died, 
 That died for the sake of the flock, 
 His love to the utmost was tried, 
 But firmly endured as a rock. 
 
 When blood from a victim must flow, 
 This Shepherd by pity was led 
 To stand between us and the foe, 
 And willingly died in our stead. 
 
 Our song, then, forever shall be 
 Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus; 
 No subject's so glorious as He, 
 No theme so affecting to us. 
 
 Of Him and His love we will sing, 
 His praises our tongues shall employ, 
 Till heavenly anthems we bring 
 In yonder bright regions of joy.
