  From all that dwell below the skies, 
 Let the Creator's praise arise; 
 Let the Redeemer's Name be sung, 
 Through every land, by every tongue. 
 
 In every land begin the song; 
 To every land the strains belong: 
 In cheerful sounds all voices raise, 
 And fill the world with loudest praise. 
 
 Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring; 
 In songs of praise divinely sing; 
 The great salvation loud proclaim, 
 And shout for joy the Saviour's Name.
