 Eternity! Time soon will end, 
 Its fleeting moments pass away; 
 O sinner, say, where wilt thou spend 
 Eternity's unchanging day? 
 Shalt thou the hopeless horror see 
 Of hell for all eternity? 
 Eternity! Eternity! 
 Where wilt thou spend eternity? 
 
 Eternity! O dreadful thought 
 For thee, a child of Adam's race, 
 If thou should'st in thy sins be brought 
 To stand before the awful face, 
 From which the heav'n and earth shall flee, 
 The throned One of eternity. 
 Eternity! Eternity! 
 Where wilt thou spend eternity? 
 
 Eternity! But Jesus died - 
 Yes, Jesus died on Calvary; 
 Behold Him thorn-crowned, crucified, 
 The spotless One made sin for thee. 
 O sinner haste! For refuge flee - 
 He saves, and for eternity. 
 Eternity! Eternity! 
 Where wilt thou spend eternity? 
 
 Tonight may be thy latest breath, 
 Thy little moment here be done; 
 Eternal woe - the second death 
 Awaits the grace rejecting 
 Thine awful destiny foresee - 
 Time ends, and then eternity. 
 Eternity! Eternity! 
 Where wilt thou spend eternity?
