  Break forth and sing the song Of Glory to the Lamb! 
 Wake ev'ry heart and ev'ry tongue, To praise the Saviour's name! 
 
 Sing of His dying love; Sing of His rising pow'r; 
 Sing how He intercedes above For those whose sins He bore. 
 
 Sing on your heav'nly road; Ye sons of glory, sing; 
 To the ascended Lamb of God, Your cheerful praises bring. 
 
 Soon shall we hear Him say, Ye ransomed pilgrims, come; 
 Soon will He call us hence away, And take us to His home. 
 
 Then shall each raptured tongue, His fullest praise proclaim; 
 And sweeter voices wake the song Of Glory to the Lamb!
