  O child of God, there is for thee, A hope that shines amid the gloom, 
 A gladsome hope that thou shalt see Thy Lord, for He will surely come. 
 
  Refrain:
He'll come, (yes, He'll come) yes, He'll come and tarry not;
He'll come, (yes, He'll come) yes, He'll come and tarry not;
He'll come, (yes, He'll come) He'll come, (yes, He'll come)
He'll come and tarry not. (and tarry not)  
 
 When in this world His hands had made, No room was found for Jesus then; 
 The mountainside was oft His bed; Now, glorified, He comes again. 
 
 Exalted now to heaven's throne, The Saviour there of sinful men; 
 His loving heart yearns o'er His own, And for them He will come again. 
 
 O child of God, thy lot may be Oft mixed with trial, grief and pain; 
 Look up, He'll surely come for thee: He says, "I'll quickly come again." 
 
 Then joy unmingled will be thine, Earth's tears and trials all forgot; 
 So cheer thy heart, no more repine, His word is sure: He'll tarry not.
