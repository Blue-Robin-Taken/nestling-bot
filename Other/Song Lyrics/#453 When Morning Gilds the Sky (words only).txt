  [Recordings forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 When morning gilds the skies, My heart awaking cries: 
 May Jesus Christ be praised; 
 Alike at work or prayer To Jesus I repair: 
 May Jesus Christ be praised. 
 
 Does sadness fill my mind, A solace here I find: 
 May Jesus Christ be praised; 
 Or fades my earthly bliss, My comfort still is this: 
 May Jesus Christ be praised. 
 
 In heaven's eternal bliss The loveliest strain is this, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised; 
 The powers of darkness fear, When this sweet chant they hear: 
 May Jesus Christ be praised. 
 
 Be this, while life is mine, My canticle divine, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised; 
 Be this th' eternal song, Through all the ages long: 
 May Jesus Christ be praised.
