  In the secret of His presence 
 How my soul delights to hide! 
 Oh, how precious are the lessons 
 Which I learn at Jesus' side! 
 Earthly cares can never vex me, 
 Neither trials lay me low; 
 For when Satan comes to tempt me, 
 To the secret place I go, 
 To the secret place I go. 
 
 When my soul is faint and thirsty, 
 'Neath the shadow of His wing 
 There is cool and pleasant shelter, 
 And a fresh and crystal spring, 
 And my Saviour rests beside me, 
 As we hold communion sweet: 
 If I tried, I could not utter 
 What He says when thus we meet, 
 What He says when thus we meet. 
 
 Only this I know: I tell Him 
 All my doubts, my griefs and fears: 
 Oh, how patiently He listens! 
 And my drooping soul He cheers: 
 Do you think He ne'er reproves me? 
 What a false friend He would be, 
 If He never, never told me, 
 Of the sins which He must see, 
 Of the sins which He must see. 
 
 Would you like to know the sweetness 
 Of the secret of the Lord? 
 Go and hide beneath His shadow: 
 This shall then be your reward; 
 And whene'er you leave the silence 
 Of that happy meeting place, 
 You must mind and bear the image 
 Of the Master in your face, 
 Of the Master in your face.
