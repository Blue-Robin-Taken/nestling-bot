  When my lifework is ended, 
 and I cross the swelling tide, 
 When the bright and glorious morning I shall see; 
 I shall know my Redeemer 
 when I reach the other side, 
 And His smile will be the first to welcome me. 
 
  Refrain:
I shall know Him, I shall know Him,
And redeemed by His side I shall stand,
I shall know Him, I shall know Him
By the print of the nails in His hand.  
 
 Oh, the soul-thrilling rapture 
 when I view His blessed face, 
 And the luster of His kindly beaming eye; 
 How my full heart will praise Him 
 for the mercy, love, and grace, 
 That prepares for me a mansion in the sky. 
 
 Oh, the dear ones in glory, 
 how they beckon me to come, 
 And our parting at the river I recall; 
 To the sweet vales of Eden 
 they will sing my welcome home; 
 But I long to meet my Saviour first of all. 
 
 Thro' the gates to the city 
 in a robe of spotless white, 
 He will lead me where no tears will ever fall; 
 In the glad song of ages 
 I shall mingle with delight; 
 But I long to meet my Saviour first of all.
