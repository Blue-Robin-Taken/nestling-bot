 Behold the Lamb, with glory crowned, 
 To Him all power is given; 
 No place too high for Him is found, 
 No place too high in heaven. 
 
 He fills the throne, the throne above, 
 He fills it without wrong; 
 The object of His Father's love, 
 The theme of heaven's song. 
 
 Though high, yet He accepts the praise 
 His people offer here; 
 The faintest, feeblest lay they raise 
 Will reach the Saviour's ear. 
 
 This song be ours, and this alone, 
 That celebrates the Name 
 Of Him who sits upon the throne, 
 And that exalts the Lamb. 
 
 To Him whom men despise and slight, 
 To Him be glory given; 
 The crown is His, and His by right 
 The highest place in heaven!
