 The King of love my Shepherd is, 
 Whose goodness faileth never; 
 I nothing lack since I am His 
 And He is mine forever. 
 
 Where streams of living water flow 
 My ransomed soul He leadeth, 
 And, where the verdant pastures grow, 
 With food celestial feedeth. 
 
 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, 
 But yet in love He sought me. 
 And on His shoulders gently laid, 
 And home rejoicing brought me. 
 
 In death's dark vale I fear no ill 
 With Thee, dear Lord, beside me; 
 Thy rod and staff my comfort still, 
 Thyself before to guide me. 
 
 And so through all the length of days 
 Thy goodness faileth never: 
 Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise 
 Within Thy house forever.
