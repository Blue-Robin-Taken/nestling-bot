  When this passing world is done, 
 When has sunk yon glaring sun, 
 When I stand with Christ on high, 
 Looking o'er life's history: 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know - 
 Not till then - how much I owe. 
 
 When I stand before the throne, 
 Dressed in beauty not my own; 
 When I see Thee as Thou art, 
 Love Thee with unsinning heart 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know - 
 Not till then - how much I owe. 
 
 When the praise of heav'n I hear, 
 Loud as thunders to the ear, 
 Loud as many waters' noise, 
 Sweet as harp's melodious voice: 
 Then, Lord, shall I fully know - 
 Not till then - how much I owe. 
 
 Chosen not for good in me; 
 Wakened up from wrath to flee; 
 Hidden in the Saviour's side; 
 By the Spirit sanctified: 
 Teach me, Lord, on earth to show, 
 By my love, how much I owe.
