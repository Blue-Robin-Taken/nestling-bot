  Fill all my vision, Savior, I pray, 
 Let me see only Jesus today; 
 Though thro' the valley Thou leadest me, 
 Thy fadeless glory encompasseth me. 
 
  Refrain:
Fill all my vision, Savior divine,
Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.
Fill all my vision, that all may see
Thy holy Image reflected in me.  
 
 Fill all my vision, every desire 
 Keep for Thy glory; my soul inspire 
 With Thy perfection, Thy holy love 
 Flooding my pathway with light from above. 
 
 Fill all my vision, let naught of sin 
 Shadow the brightness shining within. 
 Let me see only Thy blessed face, 
 Feasting my soul on Thy infinite grace.
