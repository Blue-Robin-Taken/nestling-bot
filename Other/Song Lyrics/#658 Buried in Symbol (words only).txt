  Is it Thy will that I should be 
 Buried, in symbol, Lord, with Thee; 
 Owning Thee by this solemn sign, 
 Telling the world that I am thine? 
 
 Gladly I yield obedience now; 
 In all things to Thy will I'd bow; 
 I'll follow where my Savior led, 
 And humbly in His footsteps tread. 
 
 This emblematic, wat’ry grave 
 Shows forth His love – who came to save; 
 And as I enter it, I see 
 The price my Savior paid for me. 
 
 Forth from Thy burial, Lord, I come, 
 For thou hast triumphed o’er the tomb; 
 Thy resurrection life I share - 
 My portion is no longer here. 
 
 Oh, may I count myself to be 
 Dead to the sins that wounded Thee, 
 Dead to the pleasures of this earth, 
 Unworthy of my heav’nly birth. 
 
 Lord Jesus, when I gaze on Thee, 
 And all Thy radiant glory see, 
 That joy will far exceed the shame 
 I bear on earth for Thy loved name.
