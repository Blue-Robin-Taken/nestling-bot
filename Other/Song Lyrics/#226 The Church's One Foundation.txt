  The church's one foundation 
 Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
 She is His new creation 
 By water and the word: 
 From heav’n He came and sought her 
 To be His holy bride; 
 With His own blood He bought her, 
 And for her life He died. 
 
 Elect from every nation, 
 Yet one o’er all the earth; 
 Her charter of salvation - 
 One Lord, one Faith, one birth; 
 One holy name she blesses, 
 Partakes one holy food; 
 And to one hope she presses, 
 With every grace endued. 
 
 ‘Mid toil and tribulation; 
 And tumults of her war, 
 She waits the consummation 
 Of peace forevermore: 
 Till with the vision glorious 
 Her longing eyes are blest, 
 And the great church victorious, 
 Shall be the church at rest.
