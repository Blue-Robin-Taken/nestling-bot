 Am I a soldier of the cross, 
 A follower of the Lamb, 
 And shall I fear to own His cause, 
 Or blush to speak His Name? 
 
 Must I be carried to the skies 
 On flowery beds of ease, 
 While others fought to win the prize, 
 And sailed through bloody seas? 
 
 Are there no foes for me to face? 
 Must I not stem the flood? 
 Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
 To help me on to God? 
 
 Sure I must fight if I would reign; 
 Increase my courage, Lord. 
 I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
 Supported by Thy Word.
