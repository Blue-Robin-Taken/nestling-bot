 The veil is rent: Lo! Jesus stands 
 Before the throne of grace; 
 And clouds of incense from his hands 
 Fill all that glorious place. 
 
 His precious blood is sprinkled there, 
 Before and on the throne; 
 And His own wounds in heav'n declare 
 The work that saves is done. 
 
 "Tis finished!" on the cross He said, 
 In agonies and blood; 
 'Tis finished! now He lives to plead 
 Before the face of God. 
 
 'Tis finished! here our souls can rest, 
 His work can never fail; 
 By Him our Sacrifice and Priest, 
 We enter thro' the veil. 
 
 Within the holiest of all, 
 Cleansed by His precious blood, 
 Before the throne we prostrate fall, 
 And worship Thee, our God. 
 
 Boldly our heart and voice we raise, 
 His name, His blood, our plea; 
 Assured our prayers and songs of praise 
 Ascend, by Him, to Thee.
