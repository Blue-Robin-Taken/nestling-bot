  O God our Father, we would come to Thee 
 In virtue of our Saviour's precious blood; 
 All distance gone; our souls by grace set free; 
 We worship Thee, our Father and our God. 
 
 We would, O God, present before Thy face 
 The fragrant name of Thy beloved Son; 
 By faith we view Him in that holy place, 
 Which, by His dying, He for us has won. 
 
 We share Thy joy in Him who sitteth there; 
 Our hearts delight in Thy delight in Him; 
 Chiefest of thousands, fairer than the fair; 
 His glory naught can tarnish, naught can dim. 
 
 We bow in worship now before Thy throne, 
 By faith the Object of Thy love we would see; 
 Who, in the midst, His brethrenï¿½s song doth lead. 
 To Him, our Saviour, shall the glory be!
