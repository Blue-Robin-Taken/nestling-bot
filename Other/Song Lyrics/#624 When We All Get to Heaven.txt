 Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, sing His mercy and His grace; 
 In the mansions bright and blessed, He'll prepare for us a place. 
 
  Refrain:  
 When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be! 
 When we all see Jesus, we'll sing and shout the victory. 
 
 While we walk the pilgrim pathway, clouds will overspread the sky; 
 But when traveling days are over, not a shadow, not a sigh. 
 
 Let us then be true and faithful, trusting, serving every day; 
 Just one glimpse of Him in glory will the toils of life repay. 
 
 Onward to the prize before us! Soon His beauty we'll behold; 
 Soon the pearly gates will open, we shall tread the streets of gold.
