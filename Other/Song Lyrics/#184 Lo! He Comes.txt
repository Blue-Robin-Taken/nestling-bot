  Lo! He comes, from heav'n descending, Once for favoured sinners slain! 
 Thousand thousand saints attending Swell the triumph of His train! 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Jesus comes, yes; comes to reign! 
 Jesus comes, yes; comes to reign! 
 
 See the Saviour, long expected, Now in solemn pomp appear! 
 And His saints, by man rejected, All His heavn'ly glory share; 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! See the Son of God appear! 
 See the Son of God appear! 
 
 Lo! the tokens of His passion, Though in glory still He bears; 
 Cause of endless exultation To His ransomed worshippers; 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Christ, the Lamb of God, appears; 
 Christ the Lamb of God appears! 
 
 Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee, High on Thine exalted throne; 
 Saviour, take the pow'r and glory, Claim the kingdoms for Thine own; 
 Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus! Hallelujah! Come, Lord, come! 
 Hallelujah! come, Lord, come!
