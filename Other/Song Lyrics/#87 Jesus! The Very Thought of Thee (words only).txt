  Jesus! The very thought of Thee With sweetness fills my breast; 
 But better far Thy face to see, And in Thy presence rest. 
 
 No voice can sing, no heart can frame, Nor can the memory find 
 A sweeter sound than Thy blest name, O Savior of mankind! 
 
 O hope of every contrite heart, oh joy of all the meek, 
 To those who fall, how kind Thou art: how good to those who seek! 
 
 But what to those who find? Ah! this no tongue, nor pen can show; 
 The love of Jesus! What it is none but his loved ones know. 
 
 Savior, our only joy be Thou, as Thou our crown shalt be; 
 Be Thou, oh Lord, our glory now, and through eternity.
