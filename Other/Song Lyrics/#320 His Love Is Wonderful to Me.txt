  Love divine! Oh, sing the wondrous story, 
 Far and near the glorious news proclaim; 
 How for us God's only Son was given, 
 Bringing life to all who trust His name. 
 
  REFRAIN:His love is wonderful to me....
His love is wonderful to me; ...
For Jesus loved me so,
He did to Calv'ry go;
His love is wonderful to me.  
 
 Love divine, 'twas manifest in Jesus 
 As He walked and talked by Galilee; 
 He who knew no sin became my Saviour, 
 On the cross He "paid it all" for me. 
 
 Love divine, the balm for ev'ry heartache, 
 Love divine, the refuge of my soul; 
 Take my life, possess my inmost nature, 
 Over all my being have control.
