  Savior, we remember Thee!Thy deep woe and agony, 
 All Thy suff’ring on the tree, Savior, we adore Thee! 
 
 Calvary! O Calvary! Mercy’s vast unfathomed sea, 
 Love, eternal love to me. Savior, we adore Thee! 
 
 Darkness hung around Thy head, When for sin Thy blood was shed, 
 Victim in the sinner’s stead. Savior, we adore Thee! 
 
 Jesus, Lord, Thou now art ris’n! Thou hast all our sins forgiv’n; 
 Haste we to our home in heav’n. Savior, we adore Thee! 
 
 Soon, with joyful, glad surprise, We shall hear Thy word - Arise! 
 Mounting upward to the skies. Glory, glory, glory! 
 
 Savior, we Thy love adore; We will praise Thee more and more; 
 Spread Thy name from shore to shore! Savior, we adore Thee!
