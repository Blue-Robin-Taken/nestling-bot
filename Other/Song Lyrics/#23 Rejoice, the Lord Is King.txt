  Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore, 
 Mortals, give thanks and sing, And triumph evermore; 
 
  Refrain:
Lift up your heart, Lift up your voice:
Rejoice, again, I say, rejoice.  
 
 Jesus, the Savior reigns, The God of truth and love; 
 When He had purged our stains, He took His seat above: 
 
 His kingdom cannot fail; He rules o'er earth and heaven; 
 The keys of death and hell Are to our Jesus giv'n: 
 
 He sits at God's right hand Till all His foes submit, 
 And bow to His command, And fall beneath His feet: 
 
 Rejoice in glorious hope; Jesus the Lord shall come, 
 And take His servants up To their eternal home:
