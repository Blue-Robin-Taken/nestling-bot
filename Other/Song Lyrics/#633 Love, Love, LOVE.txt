 Love, love, L-O-V-E, 
 Love, love, boundless and free; 
 Jesus left heaven to die on the tree 
 This was love, love, love! 
 
 Done, done, D-O-N-E, 
 Done, done, done perfectly! 
 "Finished!" Christ cried, when on Calv'ry He died, 
 So it's done, done, done! 
 
 Come, come, C-O-M-E, 
 Come, come, "come unto Me"; 
 Jesus receives whosoever believes, 
 When they come, come, come! 
 
 Mine, mine, M-I-N-E, 
 Mine, mine, eternally; 
 Wonderful love, Jesus came from above 
 To be mine, mine, mine!
