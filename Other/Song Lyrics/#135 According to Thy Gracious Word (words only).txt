  According to Thy gracious word, In deep humility 
 This would I do, O Christ, my Lord, I would remember Thee. 
 
 The body, given for my sake, My bread from heav’n shall be: 
 Thy testamental cup I take, And thus remember Thee. 
 
 Remember Thee, and all Thy pains, And all Thy love to me; 
 Yea, while a breath – a pulse remains, Would I remember Thee. 
 
 And when, O Lord, Thou com’st again, And I Thy glory see, 
 Forever as the Lamb once slain, I will remember Thee.
