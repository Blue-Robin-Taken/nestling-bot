 Worthy of homage and praise; 
 Worthy by all to be adored: 
 Exhaustless theme of heav'nly lays! 
 Thou, Thou are worthy, Jesus, Lord. 
 
 Now seated on Jehovah's throne, 
 The Lamb once slain, in glory bright: 
 'Tis thence Thou watchest o'er Thine own, 
 Guarding us thro' the deadly fight. 
 
 To Thee, e'en now, our song we raise, 
 Tho' sure the tribute mean must prove: 
 No mortal tongue can tell Thy ways, 
 So full of light and life and love. 
 
 Yet, Savior, Thou shalt have full praise: 
 We soon shall meet Thee on the cloud, 
 We soon shall see Thee face to face, 
 In glory praising as we would.
