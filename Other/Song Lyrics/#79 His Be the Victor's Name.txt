  His be the Victor's name, 
 Who fought the fight alone; 
 Triumphant saints no honor claim, 
 Triumphant saints no honor claim, 
 His conquest was their own. 
 
 By weakness and defeat, 
 He won a glorious crown, 
 Trod all our foes beneath His feet, 
 Trod all our foes beneath His feet, 
 By being trodden down. 
 
 He Satan's power laid low; 
 Made sin, He sin o'er-threw. 
 Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so, 
 Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so, 
 And death by dying slew. 
 
 Bless, bless the Conquer'r slain, 
 Slain in His victory; 
 Who lived, Who died, Who lives again, 
 Who lived, Who died, Who lives again- 
 For thee, His church, for thee!
