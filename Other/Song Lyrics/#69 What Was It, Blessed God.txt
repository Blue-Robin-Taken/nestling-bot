 What was it, blessed God, Led Thee to give Thy Son, 
 To yield Thy well-beloved For us by sin undone? 
 'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus 
 To give Thy well-beloved for us. 
 To give Thy well-beloved for us. 
 
 What led Thy Son, O God, To leave Thy throne on high, 
 To shed His precious blood, To suffer and to die? 
 'Twas love unbounded love to us 
 Led Him to die and suffer thus. 
 Led Him to die and suffer thus. 
 
 What moved Thee to impart Thy Spirit from above, 
 Therewith to fill our heart With heav'nly peace and love? 
 'Twas love unbounded love to us 
 Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus. 
 Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus. 
 
 What love to Thee we owe, Our God, for all Thy grace! 
 Our hearts may well o'erflow In everlasting praise! 
 We join, O Lord, to praise Thee thus, 
 For all Thy boundless love to us! 
 For all Thy boundless love to us!
