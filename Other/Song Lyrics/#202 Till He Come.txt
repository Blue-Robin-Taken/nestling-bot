  "Till He come!" O let the words 
 Linger on the trembling chords; 
 Let the "little while" between 
 In their golden light be seen; 
 Let us think how heaven and home 
 Lie beyond that "Till He come!" 
 
 When the weary ones we love 
 Enter on their rest above, 
 When their words of love and cheer 
 Fall no longer on our ear, 
 Hush! be every murmur dumb, 
 It is only "Till He come!" 
 
 Clouds and darkness round us press; 
 Would we have one sorrow less? 
 All the sharpness of the cross, 
 All that tells the world is loss, 
 Death, and darkness, and the tomb, 
 Pain us only "Till He come!" 
 
 Sweet the feast of love divine, 
 Broken bread and outpoured wine; 
 Sweet memorials, 'till the Lord 
 Call us round His heavenly board, 
 Some from earth, for glory some, 
 Severed only "Till He come!"
