  [Recordings forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 Would you be free from your burden of sin? 
 There’s power in the blood, power in the blood; 
 Would you o’er evil a victory win? 
 There’s wonderful power in the blood. 
 
  Refrain:
There is power, power, wonder-working power,
In the blood of the Lamb;
There is power, power, wonder-working power,
In the precious blood of the Lamb.  
 
 Would you be free from your passion and pride? 
 There’s power in the blood, power in the blood; 
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide, 
 There’s wonderful power in the blood. 
 
 Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow? 
 There’s power in the blood, power in the blood; 
 Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow, 
 There’s wonderful power in the blood. 
 
 Would you do service for Jesus your King? 
 There’s power in the blood, power in the blood; 
 Would you live daily His praises to sing? 
 There’s wonderful power in the blood.
