  Once more, before we part, 
 Bless the Redeemer's name: 
 Let ev'ry tongue and heart 
 Praise and adore the Lamb. 
 
  Refrain:
Jesus, the sinner's Friend,
Him whom our souls adore;
His praises have no end:
Praise him forever more.  
 
 Lord, in Thy grace we came; 
 That blessing still impart: 
 We met in Jesus' name: 
 In Jesus' name we part. 
 
 Still on Thy holy Word 
 We'd live, and feed, and grow; 
 Go on to know the Lord, 
 And practice what we know.
