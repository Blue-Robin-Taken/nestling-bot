 Let us love, and sing, and wonder, 
 Let us praise the Saviour's name! 
 He has hushed the Law's loud thunder, 
 He has quenched Mount Sinai's flame; 
 He has washed us in His blood, 
 He has brought us nigh to God. 
 
 Let us love the Lord who bought us, 
 Pitied us when enemies, 
 Called us by His grace, and taught us, 
 Gave use ears, and gave us eyes: 
 He has washed us in His blood, 
 He presents our souls to God. 
 
 Let us sing, though fierce temptations 
 Threaten hard to bear us down! 
 For the Lord, our strong salvation, 
 Holds in view the conqueror's crown, 
 He who washed us in His blood, 
 Soon will bring us home to God. 
 
 Let us wonder; grace and justice 
 Join, and point to mercy's store; 
 When through grace in Christ our trust is, 
 Justice smiles, and asks no more: 
 He who washed us in His blood, 
 Has secured our way to God. 
 
 Let us praise, and join the chorus 
 Of the saints enthroned on high; 
 Here they trusted Him before us, 
 Now their praises fill the sky: 
 "Thou hast washed us with Thy blood; 
 Thou art worthy, Lamb of God."
