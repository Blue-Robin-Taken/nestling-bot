  Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee; 
 Let the water and the blood, 
 From Thy riven side which flowed, 
 Be of sin the double cure, 
 Cleanse me from its guilt and power. 
 
 Not the labor of my hands 
 Can fulfill Thy lawâ€™s demands; 
 Could my zeal no respite know, 
 Could my tears forever flow, 
 All for sin could not atone, 
 Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
 
 Nothing in my hands I bring, 
 Simply to Thy cross I cling; 
 Naked, come to Thee for dress, 
 Helpless, look to Thee for grace: 
 Foul, I to the fountain fly, 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die. 
 
 While I draw this fleeting breath, 
 When mine eyes shall close in death, 
 When I soar to worlds unknown, 
 See Thee on Thy judgment throne, 
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee.
