 O Head once filled with bruises, 
 Oppressed with pain and scorn, 
 O'erwhelmed with sore abuses, 
 Mocked with a crown of thorn! 
 O Head to death once wounded 
 In shame upon the tree, 
 In glory now surrounded 
 With brightest majesty! 
 
 Thou Lord of all transcendent, 
 Thou life-creating Sun 
 To worlds on Thee dependent, 
 Yet bruised and spit upon! 
 O Lord! what Thee tormented 
 Was our sin's heavy load; 
 We had the debt augmented, 
 Which Thou didst pay in blood. 
 
 We give Thee thanks unfeigned, 
 Lord Jesus, Friend in need! 
 For what Thy soul sustained 
 When Thou for us didst bleed; 
 Grant us to lean unshaken 
 Upon Thy faithfulness, 
 Until, to glory taken, 
 We see Thee face to face.
