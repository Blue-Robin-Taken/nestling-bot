  When all my labors and trials are o'er, 
 And I am safe on that beautiful shore, 
 Just to be near the dear Lord I adore, 
 Will through the ages be glory for me. 
 
  Refrain:
O that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.  
 
 When, by the gift of His infinite grace, 
 I am accorded in heaven a place, 
 Just to be there and to look on His face, 
 Will through the ages be glory for me. 
 
 Friends will be there I have loved long ago; 
 Joy like a river around me will flow; 
 Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know 
 Will through the ages be glory for me.
