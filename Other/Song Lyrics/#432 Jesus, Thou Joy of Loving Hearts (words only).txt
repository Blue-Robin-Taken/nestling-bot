  Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts, 
 Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men, 
 From the best bliss that earth imparts, 
 We turn unfilled to Thee again. 
 
 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood; 
 Thou savest those that on Thee call; 
 To them that seek Thee, O how good, 
 To them that find Thee, All in All! 
 
 We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread, 
 And long to feast upon Thee still; 
 We drink of Thee, the Fountain Head, 
 And thirst our souls from Thee to fill! 
 
 Our eager spirits yearn for Thee, 
 Where’er our changeful lot is cast; 
 Glad since Thy gracious smile we see, 
 Blest, since our faith can hold Thee fast. 
 
 O Lord, be Thou our strength and stay! 
 Make all our moments calm and bright, 
 Chase all dark thoughts of sin away, 
 Shed o’er us here Thy holy light.
