  Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains, 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echo back their joyous strains. 
 
  Refrain:
Gloria in excelsis Deo!
Gloria in excelsis Deo!  
 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 Say what may the tidings be 
 Which inspire your heav'nly song. 
 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him whose birth the angels sing; 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
