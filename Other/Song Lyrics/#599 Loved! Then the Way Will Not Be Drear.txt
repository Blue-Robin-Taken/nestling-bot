  Loved! then the way will not be drear; 
 For One we know is ever near, 
 Proving it to our hearts so clear 
 That we are loved. 
 
 Loved with an everlasting love 
 By Him who left His home above, 
 To bring us life, and light, and love, 
 Because He loved. 
 
 Loved, when our sky is clouded o'er, 
 And days of sorrow press us sore; 
 Still will we trust Him evermore, 
 For we are loved. 
 
 Loved, when we leave our native soil, 
 In heathen lands to live and toil; 
 Under His shadow nought can foil - 
 Still we are loved. 
 
 Time, that affects all things below, 
 Can never change the love He'll show; 
 The heart of Christ with love will flow, 
 And we are loved. 
 
 Loved in the past of yesterday, 
 And all along our future way, 
 And in the pesent of today - 
 Forever loved. 
 
 Loved when we sing the glad new song 
 To Christ, for whom we've waited long, 
 With all the happy, ransomed throng - 
 Forever loved.
