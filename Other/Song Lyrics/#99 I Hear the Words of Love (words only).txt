  [Recording forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 I hear the words of love, God looks upon the blood, 
 Accepts the mighty sacrifice, And I have peace with God. 
 
 'Tis everlasting peace! Sure as Jehovah's Name, 
 'Tis stable as His steadfast throne, Forevermore the same. 
 
 I change, He changes not; The Christ can never die: 
 His love, not mine, the resting place, His truth, not mine, the tie. 
 
 The cross still stands unchanged, Though heav'n is now His home; 
 The mighty stone is rolled away, But yonder is His tomb! 
 
 And yonder is my peace, The grave of all my woes! 
 I know the Son of God has come, I know He died and rose. 
 
 I know He liveth now At God's right hand above; 
 I know the throne on which He sits, I know His truth and love!
