 Lamb of God! our souls adore Thee 
 While upon Thy face we gaze; 
 There the Father's love and glory 
 Shine in all their brightest rays; 
 Thy Almighty pow'r and wisdom 
 All creation's works proclaim; 
 Heaven and earth alike confess Thee, 
 As the ever great "I AM." 
 
 Lamb of God! Thy Father's bosom 
 Ever was Thy dwelling place; 
 His delight, in Him rejoicing, 
 One with Him in power and grace; 
 Oh what wondrous love and mercy! 
 Thou did'st lay Thy glory by; 
 And for us did'st come from heaven 
 As the Lamb of God to die. 
 
 Lamb of God! when we behold Thee 
 Lowly in the manger laid, 
 Wand'ring as a homeless stranger 
 In the world thy hands had made; 
 When we see Thee in the garden 
 In Thine agony of blood - 
 At Thy grace we are confounded, 
 Holy, spotless Lamb of God! 
 
 When we see Thee as the Victim, 
 Nailed to the accursed tree, 
 For our guilt and folly stricken, 
 All our judgment borne by Thee, 
 Lord, we own, with hearts adoring, 
 Thou hast loved us unto blood; 
 Glory, glory everlasting 
 Be to Thee, Thou Lamb of God! 
 
 Lamb of God! Thou now art seated 
 High upon Thy Father's throne; 
 All Thy gracious work completed, 
 All Thy mighty victory won. 
 Every knee in heav'n is bending 
 To the Lamb for sinners slain; 
 Every voice and harp is swelling, 
 "Worthy is the Lamb to reign!"
