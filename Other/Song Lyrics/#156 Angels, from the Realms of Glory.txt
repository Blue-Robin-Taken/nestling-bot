  Angels, from the realms of glory, 
 wing your flight o'er all the earth; 
 ye who sang creation's story, 
 now proclaim Messiah's birth: 
 
  Refrain:
Come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King.  
 
 Shepherds in the fields abiding, 
 watching o'er your flocks by night, 
 God with man is now residing, 
 yonder shines the infant Light: 
 
 Sages, leave your contemplations, 
 brighter visions beam afar; 
 seek the great Desire of nations; 
 ye have seen his natal star: 
 
 Saints before the altar bending, 
 watching long in hope and fear, 
 suddenly the Lord, descending, 
 in his temple shall appear: 
 
 Sinners wrung with true repentance, 
 Doomed for guilt to endless pains, 
 Justice now revokes the sentence, 
 Mercy calls you, break your chains:
