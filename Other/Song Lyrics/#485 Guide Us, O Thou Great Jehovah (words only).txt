  Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, Pilgrims thro’ this barren land; We are weak, but Thou art mighty; Hold us by Thy pow’rful hand: Bread of heaven, Feed us now and evermore. 
 Bread of heaven, Feed us now and evermore. 
 
 Open wide the living fountain, Whence that healing waters flow; 
 Be Thy-self our cloudy pillar All the dreary desert thro’: 
 Strong Deliv’rer, Be Thou still our strength and shield. 
 Strong Deliv’rer, Be Thou still our strength and shield. 
 
 While we tread this vale of sorrow, May we in Thy love abide; 
 Keep us, O our gracious Savior! Cleaving closely to Thy side:Still relying On our Father’s changeless love. 
 Still relying On our Father’s changeless love. 
 
 Savior, come! we long to see Thee, Long to dwell with Thee above; And to know, in full communion, All the sweetness of Thy love: Come, Lord Jesus! Take Thy waiting people home. 
 Come, Lord Jesus! Take Thy waiting people home.
