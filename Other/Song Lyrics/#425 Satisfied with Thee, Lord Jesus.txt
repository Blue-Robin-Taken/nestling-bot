 Satisfied with Thee, Lord Jesus, I am blest; 
 Peace which passeth understanding, on Thy breast; 
 No more doubting, no more trembling, 
 Oh, what rest! Oh, what rest! 
 
 Occupied with Thee, Lord Jesus, in Thy grace; 
 All Thy ways and thoughts about me only trace 
 Deeper stories of the glories 
 Of Thy grace, of Thy grace. 
 
 Taken up with Thee, Lord Jesus, I would be; 
 Finding joy and satisfaction all in Thee; 
 Thou the nearest and the dearest 
 Unto me, unto me. 
 
 Listening for Thy shout, Lord Jesus, in the air! 
 When Thy saints shall rise with joy to meet Thee there; 
 O what gladness! no more sadness, 
 Sin nor care, sin nor care.
