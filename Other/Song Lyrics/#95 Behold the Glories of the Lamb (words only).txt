  Behold the glories of the Lamb 
 Amidst the Father's throne! 
 Prepare new honors for His name, 
 And songs before unknown! 
 
 Ye elders, worship at His feet - 
 His saints adore around, 
 With vials full of odors sweet, 
 And harps of sweetest sound! 
 
 To Thee, O Lamb, to Thee, once slain, 
 Be endless blessings paid! 
 Salvation, glory, joy, remain 
 Forever on Thy head!
