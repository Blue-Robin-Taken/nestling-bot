  Down from the splendor of His everlasting home, 
 Came the Lord of Glory for our guilt to atone; 
 Son of God, Eternal, He the sinner's surety stood, 
 Paid the sinner's ransom in His precious blood. 
 
  Refrain:
Glory! Glory! Glory unto Jesus,
Anyone, everyone, He can fully save;
Glory! Glory! Glory unto Jesus,
Hallelujah! All who trust Him He will save.  
 
 O'er death triumphant He is risen from the grave, 
 Back to heav'n ascended Jesus now lives to save; 
 Nothing else remaineth but salvation to receive, 
 And the way to get it is to just believe. 
 
 Come then to Jesus; do not longer stay away, 
 Come and take salvation, take it now while you may; 
 Heav'nly voices call you, and the Saviour waits to bless, 
 Come to Him believing, and His name confess.
