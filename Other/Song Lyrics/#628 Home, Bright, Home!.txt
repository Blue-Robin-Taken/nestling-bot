  No future but glory, Lord Jesus, have we, 
 How bright is the prospect of being with Thee! 
 O Home of all homes, with the Father above, 
 O wonderful dwelling of infinite love! 
 O wonderful dwelling of infinite love! 
 
 No future but glory, Lord Jesus, have we, 
 For man is in glory already, in Thee; 
 The brighter the glory that shines in Thy face, 
 The clearer our title to glory, through grace. 
 The clearer our title to glory, through grace. 
 
 This one thing we'd do, we would press t'ward the goal, 
 Thyself, Lord, in glory the prize of our soul; 
 Forget what's behind, for the bright things before, 
 Since all they who know Thee would know Thee still more. 
 Since all they who know Thee would know Thee still more. 
 
 In heaven alone is our city and state, 
 From thence, Lord, as Saviour, Thyself we await; 
 Our bodies to change, and conform them to Thine, 
 That we in Thine image and glory may shine. 
 That we in Thine image and glory may shine.
