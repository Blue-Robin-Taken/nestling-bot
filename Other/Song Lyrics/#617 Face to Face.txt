  Face to face with Christ my Saviour, 
 Face to face - what will it be - 
 When with rapture I behold Him, 
 Jesus Christ Who died for me? 
 
  Refrain:
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!  
 
 Only faintly now I see Him, 
 With the darkling veil between; 
 But a blessed day is coming, 
 When His glory shall be seen. 
 
 What rejoicing in His presence, 
 When are banished grief and pain; 
 When the crooked ways are straightened, 
 And the dark things shall be plain. 
 
 Face to face! O blissful moment! 
 Face to face - to see and know; 
 Face to face with my Redeemer, 
 Jesus Christ Who loves me so.
