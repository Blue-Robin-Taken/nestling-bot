  Fairest Lord Jesus! 
 Ruler of all nature! 
 O Thou of God and man the Son! 
 Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, 
 Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown! 
 
 Fair are the meadows, 
 Fairer still the woodlands, 
 Robed in the blooming garb of spring: 
 Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer, 
 Who makes the woeful heart to sing. 
 
 Fair is the sunshine, 
 Fairer still the moonlight, 
 And all the twinkling starry host: 
 Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer 
 Than all the angels heav'n can boast. 
 
 Beautiful Saviour! 
 Lord of the nations! 
 Son of God and Son of Man! 
 Glory and honor, Praise, adoration 
 Now and forevermore be Thine!
