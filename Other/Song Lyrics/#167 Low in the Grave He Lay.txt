  Low in the grave He lay - Jesus my Savior! 
 Waiting the coming day - Jesus my Lord! 
 
  Refrain:
Up from the grave He arose, (He arose,)
With a mighty triumph oâ€™er His foes; (He arose!)
He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
And he lives forever with His saints to reign.
He arose! (He arose!) He arose! (He arose!)
Hallelujah! Christ arose!  
 
 Vainly they watch His bed - Jesus my Savior! 
 Vainly they seal the dead - Jesus my Lord! 
 
 Death cannot keep his prey - Jesus my Savior! 
 He tore the bars away - Jesus my Lord!
