 Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art; 
 That, that alone can be my soul's true rest; 
 Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart, 
 And stills the tempest of my tossing breast. 
 
 Thy Name is Love! I hear it from yon cross; 
 Thy Name is Love! I read it in yon tomb; 
 All meaner love is perishable dross, 
 But this shall light me through time's thickest gloom. 
 
 It blesses now, and shall forever bless: 
 It saves me now, and shall forever save; 
 It holds me up in days of helplessness, 
 It bears me safely o'er each swelling wave. 
 
 'Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God, 
 That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song; 
 Thou are my health, my joy, my staff, my rod; 
 Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong. 
 
 More of Thyself, oh, show me, hour by hour; 
 More of Thy glory, O my God and Lord; 
 More of Thyself in all Thy grace and pow'r; 
 More of Thy love and truth, Incarnate Word.
