  [Recording forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 Sweet feast of love divine! 
 Tis grace that makes us free 
 To feed upon this bread and wine, 
 In mem’ry, Lord, of Thee. 
 
 Here every welcome guest 
 Waits, Lord, from Thee to learn 
 The secrets of Thy Father’s breast, 
 And all Thy grace discern. 
 
 Here conscience ends its strife, 
 And faith delights to prove 
 The sweetness of the Bread of Life, 
 The fullness of Thy love. 
 
 That blood that flowed for sin 
 In symbol here we see, 
 And feel the blessed pledge within 
 That we are loved of Thee. 
 
 O if this glimpse of love 
 Is so divinely sweet, 
 What will it be, O Lord, above, 
 Thy gladd’ning smile to meet! 
 
 To see Thee face to face, 
 Thy perfect likeness wear, 
 And all Thy ways of wondrous grace 
 Through endless years declare.
