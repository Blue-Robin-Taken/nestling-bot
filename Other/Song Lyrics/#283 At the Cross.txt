  Alas! and did my Savior bleed? 
 And did my Sovereign die? 
 Would He devote that sacred head 
 For such a worm as I? 
 
  Refrain:
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!  
 
 Was it for crimes that I have done 
 He groaned upon the tree? 
 Amazing pity! grace unknown! 
 And love beyond degree! 
 
 Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
 And shut his glories in, 
 When the incarnate Maker died 
 For man, His creature's sin. 
 
 Thus might I hide my blushing face, 
 While His dear cross appears; 
 Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
 And melt my eyes to tears.
