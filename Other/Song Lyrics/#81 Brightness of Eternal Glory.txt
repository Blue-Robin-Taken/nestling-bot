  Brightness of eternal glory, 
 Shall Thy praise unuttered lie? 
 Who would hush the heaven-sent story 
 Of the Lamb who came to die? 
 
 Came from Godhead's fullest glory 
 Down to Calvery's depth of woe, 
 Now on high, we bow before Thee; 
 Streams of praises ceaseless flow! 
 
 Sing His blest triumphant rising; 
 Sing Him on the Father's throne; 
 Sing - till heaven and earth surprising, 
 Reigns the Nazarene alone.
