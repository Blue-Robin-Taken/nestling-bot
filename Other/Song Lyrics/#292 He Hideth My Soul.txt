  A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, 
 a wonderful Savior to me; 
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
 where rivers of pleasure I see. 
 
  Refrain:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
that shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
and covers me there with His hand,
and covers me there with His hand.  
 
 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, 
 He taketh my burden away; 
 He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved, 
 He giveth me strength as my day. 
 
 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
 and filled with His fullness divine, 
 I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God 
 for such a Redeemer as mine! 
 
 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
 to meet Him in clouds of the sky, 
 His perfect salvation, His wonderful love 
 I'll shout with the millions on high.
