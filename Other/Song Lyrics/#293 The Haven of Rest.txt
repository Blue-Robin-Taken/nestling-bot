  My soul in sad exile was out on life's sea, 
 So burdened with sin and distrest, 
 Till I heard a sweet voice saying "Make Me your choice," 
 And I entered the haven of rest. 
 
  Refrain:  
 I've anchored my soul in the haven of rest, 
 I'll sail the wide seas no more; 
 The tempest may sweep o'er the wild stormy deep, 
 In Jesus I'm safe evermore. 

I yielded myself to His tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul:
The haven of rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus Who'll save who-so ever will have
A home in the haven of rest.

Oh, come to the Saviour, He patiently waits
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the haven of rest,
And say, "My Beloved is mine."
