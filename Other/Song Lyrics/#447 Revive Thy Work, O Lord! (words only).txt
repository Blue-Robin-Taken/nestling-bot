  "Revive Thy work, O Lord!" 
 Thy mighty arm make bare: 
 Speak with the voice which wakes the dead, 
 And make Thy people hear. 
 
 "Revive Thy work, O Lord!" 
 Disturb this sleep of death: 
 Quicken the smoldering embers, Lord, 
 By Thine almighty breath. 
 
 "Revive Thy work, O Lord! 
 Create soul-thirst for Thee: 
 And hungering for the Bread of Life 
 O may our spirits be! 
 
 "Revive Thy work, O Lord!" 
 Give power unto Thy Word; 
 Grant that Thy blessed gospel may 
 In living faith be heard. 
 
 "Revive Thy work, O Lord!" 
 And give refreshing showers: 
 The glory shall be all Thine own, 
 The blessing, Lord, be ours!
