  It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine, 
 Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet this soul of mine 
 Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length, 
 Its height and depth, its everlasting strength, 
 Know more and more. 
 
 It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine, 
 Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet these lips of mine 
 Would fain proclaim to sinners far and near 
 A love which can remove all guilty fear, 
 And love beget 
 
 It passeth praises! that dear love of Thine, 
 Lord Jesus, Saviour: yet this heart of mine 
 Would sing a love so rich, so full, so free, 
 Which bro't a rebel sinner, such as me, 
 Nigh unto God. 
 
 But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know 
 The fullness of Thy love, while here below, 
 My empty vessel I may freely bring: 
 O Thou, who art of love the living spring, 
 My vessel fill. 
 
 Then fill me, O my Saviour, with Thy love! 
 Lead, lead me to the living fount above: 
 Thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh, 
 And never to another fountain fly, 
 But unto Thee. 
 
 Then fill me, O my Saviour, with Thy love! 
 Lead, lead me to the living fount above: 
 Thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh, 
 And never to another fountain fly, 
 But unto Thee.
