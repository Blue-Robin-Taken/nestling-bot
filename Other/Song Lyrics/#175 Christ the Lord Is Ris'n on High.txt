  Christ the Lord is ris'n on high! 
 Sing, ye heav'ns, and earth reply; 
 He endured the cross, the grave, 
 Sinners to redeem and save. 
 Sinners to redeem and save. 
 
 Love's redeeming work is done, 
 Fought the fight, the battle won! 
 He Himself our ransom paid, 
 Peace with God forever made. 
 Peace with God forever made. 
 
 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, 
 Christ has burst the gates of hell; 
 Vain their efforts to enthrall, 
 He has triumphed over all! 
 He has triumphed over all! 
 
 Christ our Lord is ris'n indeed, 
 He is now the Church's Head; 
 Loud the song of triumph raise, 
 Celebrate the Victor's praise! 
 Celebrate the Victor's praise.
