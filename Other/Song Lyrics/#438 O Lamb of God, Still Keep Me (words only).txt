  O Lamb of God, still keep me 
 Near to Thy wounded side; 
 'Tis only there in safety 
 And peace I can abide. 
 With foes and snares around me, 
 And lusts and fears within, 
 The grace that sought and found me, 
 Alone can keep me clean. 
 
 'Tis only in Thee hiding, 
 I know my life secure; 
 Only in Thee abiding, 
 I steadfast shall endure: 
 Thine arm the vict'ry gaineth 
 O'er ev'ry hurtful foe; 
 Thy love my heart sustaineth 
 In all its cares and woe. 
 
 Soon shall mine eyes behold Thee, 
 With rapture face to face; 
 The half has not been told me 
 Of all Thy pow'r and grace; 
 Thy beauty, Lord, and glory, 
 The wonders of Thy love, 
 Shall be the endless story, 
 Of all Thy saints above!
