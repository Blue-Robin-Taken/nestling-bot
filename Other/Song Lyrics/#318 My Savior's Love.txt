 I stand amazed in the presence 
 Of Jesus the Nazarene, 
 And wonder how He could love me, 
 A sinner, condemned, unclean. 
 
  Refrain
How marvelous! how wonderful! And my song shall ever be:
(TB) Oh, how marvelous! Oh how wonderful! And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful Is my Saviour's love for me!
(TB) Oh how marvelous! Oh how wonderful! Is my Saviour's love for me!  
 
 For me it was in the garden 
 He prayed: "Not my will but Thine" 
 He had no tears for His own griefs, 
 But sweat drops of blood for mine 
 
 He took my sins and my sorrows, 
 He made them His very own; 
 He bore the burden to Calvary, 
 And suffered and died alone. 
 
 When with the ransomed in glory 
 His face I at last shall see, 
 'Twill be my joy through the ages 
 To sing of His love for me.
