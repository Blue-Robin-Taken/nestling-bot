 Hark! sinner, hark! we have tidings so true, 
 Tidings of pardon and blessings for you! 
 God in His word says that Christ on the tree, 
 Died for guilty sinners, and "Salvation is free." 
 
  Refrain:
Hear the news sinner, free! free! free!
Why not believe it? 'Tis good news for thee.
Jesus the Just One has died on the tree,
Died for guilty sinners, and "Salvation is free."  
 
 Guilty you are, yet you know very well 
 Jesus has suffered to save you from hell; 
 Though now condemned, justified you may be, 
 Jesus paid the ransom, and "Salvation is free." 
 
 Trust not in "doing," it cannot avail. 
 Good resolutions and works can but fail; 
 "Grace, grace alone," is the saved sinner's plea, 
 "Not of works," the Scriptures say, "Salvation is free." 
 
 Trust not in feelings, your heart is depraved. 
 Trust only Jesus, who now lives to save; 
 Tears of repentance, though real they may be, 
 Ne'er can purchase heaven, for "Salvation is free."
