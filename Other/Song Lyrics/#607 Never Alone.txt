  How many times discouraged, 
 We sink beside the way; 
 About us all is darkness, 
 We hardly dare to pray; 
 Then from the mists and shadows, 
 The sweetest voice e'er known, 
 Says, "Child, am I not with Thee, 
 Never to leave thee alone?" 
 
  REFRAIN:
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone!
No, never alone! No, never alone!
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone!  
 
 O soul, hast thou forgotten, 
 The tender word and sweet, 
 Of Him who left behind Him 
 The print of bleeding feet? 
 "I never will forsake thee, 
 O child so weary grown; 
 Remember, I have promised, 
 Never to leave thee alone." 
 
 Take courage, wayworn pilgrim, 
 Tho' mists and shadows hide 
 The face of Him thou lovest, 
 He's ever at thy side; 
 Reach out thy hand and find Him, 
 And lo, the clouds have flown; 
 He smiles on thee who promised, 
 Never to leave thee alone.
