  Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh, 
 When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee; 
 Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight, 
 Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee. 
 
 Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows, 
 The solemn hush of nature newly born; 
 Alone with Thee in breathless adoration, 
 In the calm dew and freshness of the morn. 
 
 When sinks the soul subdued by toil, to slumber, 
 Its closing eyes look up to Thee in prayer; 
 Sweet the repose between thy winds o'er-shading 
 But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there! 
 
 So shall it be at last, in that bright morning, 
 When the soul waketh and life's shadows flee; 
 Oh, in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning, 
 Shall rise the glorious thought - I am with Thee. 
 
 [alternate verse 4: 
 So it shall be at last in that bright morning, 
 When the Lord cometh and the shadows flee 
 O in that hour, fairer than daylight's dawning 
 Shall rise this glorious thought: I am with Thee!]
