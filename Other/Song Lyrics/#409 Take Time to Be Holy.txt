  Take time to be holy, speak oft with Thy Lord; 
 Abide in Him always, and feed on His Word. 
 Make friends of God's children, 
 help those who are weak; 
 Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek. 
 
 Take time to be holy, the world rushes on; 
 Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone, 
 By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be; 
 Thy friends in thy conduct 
 His likeness shall see. 
 
 Take time to be holy, let Him be thy guide, 
 And run not before Him, whatever betide; 
 In joy or in sorrow, still follow thy Lord, 
 And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His Word. 
 
 Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul; 
 Each thought and each motive beneath His control; 
 Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love, 
 Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.
