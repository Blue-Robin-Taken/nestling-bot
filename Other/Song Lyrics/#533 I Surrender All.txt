  All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give; 
 I would ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live. 
 
  Refrain:
I surrender all, I surrender all;
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all.  
 
 All to Jesus I surrender, Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine; 
 May Thy Holy Spirit fill me, May I know Thy pow'r Divine. 
 
 All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give myself to Thee; 
 Fill me with Thy love and power, Let Thy blessing fall on me.
