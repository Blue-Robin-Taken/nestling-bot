 WORDS IN HYMNS OF WORSHIP &amp; REMEMBRANCE: 
 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing, 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace; 
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
 Call for songs of loudest praise. 
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
 Wand'ring from the fold of God; 
 He, to save my soul from danger, 
 Interposed His precious blood. 
 
 O to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I'm constrained to be! 
 Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter, 
 Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee. 
 Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure, 
 Meet for blood-bought hosts above; 
 While I sing the countless treasure 
 Of my God's unchanging love. 
 
 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it; 
 Prone to leave the God I love: 
 Yet Thou, Lord, hast deigned to seal it; 
 With Thy Spirit from above. 
 Rescued thus from sin and danger, 
 Purchased by the Savior's blood, 
 May I walk on earth a stranger, 
 As a son and heir of God.
