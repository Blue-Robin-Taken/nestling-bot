  O Lord my God!When I in awesome wonder 
 Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made, 
 I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, 
 Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed, 
 
  Refrain:
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!  
 
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander 
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees; 
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur 
 And heart the brook and feel the gentle breeze; 
 
 And when I think that God, His Son not sparing 
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in; 
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
 He bled and died to take away my sin; 
 
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation 
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! 
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration 
 And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
