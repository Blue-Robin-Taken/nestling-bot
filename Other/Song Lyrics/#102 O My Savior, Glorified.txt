  O my Savior, glorified! Now the heavens, opened wide, 
 Show to faith's exultant eye One in beauteous majesty. 
 
 Worthy of the sweetest praise That my ransomed heart can raise, 
 Is that Man in whom alone God Himself is fully known. 
 
 For those clust'ring glories prove That glad gospel, "God is Love," 
 Whilst those wounds, in glory bright, Voice the solemn, "God is Light." 
 
 Hark, my soul! thy Savior sings; Catch the joy that music brings; 
 And, with that sweet flood of song, Pour thy whispering praise along. 
 
 O my Savior, glorified, Turn my eye from all beside, 
 Let me but Thy beauty see, - Other light is dark to me.
