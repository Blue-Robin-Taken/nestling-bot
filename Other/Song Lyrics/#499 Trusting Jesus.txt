  Simply trusting every day, trusting through a stormy way; 
 Even when my faith is small, trusting Jesus that is all. 
 
  Refrain:
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by;
Trusting Him whate'er befall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.  
 
 Brightly doth His Spirit shine into this poor heart of mine; 
 While He leads I cannot fall; trusting Jesus that is all. 
 
 Singing if my way is clear; praying if the path be drear; 
 If in danger, for Him call trusting Jesus that is all. 
 
 Trusting Him while life shall last, trusting Him till earth be past; 
 Till within the jasper wall; trusting Jesus that is all.
