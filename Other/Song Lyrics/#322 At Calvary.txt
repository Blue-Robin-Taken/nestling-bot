 Years I spent in vanity and pride, 
 Caring not my Lord was crucified, 
 Knowing not it was for me He died 
 On Calvary. 
 
  Refrain:
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
At Calvary.  
 
 By God's Word at least my sin I learned; 
 Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned, 
 Till my guilty soul imploring turned 
 To Calvary. 
 
 Now I've given to Jesus everything; 
 Now I gladly own Him as my King; 
 Now my raptured soul can only sing 
 Of Calvary. 
 
 Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan! 
 Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! 
 Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span 
 At Calvary!
