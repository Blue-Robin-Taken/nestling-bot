 Crown Him with many crowns, 
 The Lamb upon His throne: 
 Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns 
 All music but its own. 
 Awake, my soul, and sing 
 Of Him who died for thee, 
 And hail Him as thy matchless King 
 Thru all eternity. 
 
 Crown Him the Lord of love, 
 Behold His hands and side, 
 Rich wounds, yet visible above, 
 In beauty glorified. 
 No angel in the sky 
 Can fully bear that sight, 
 But downward bends his wondering eye 
 At mysteries so bright. 
 
 Crown Him the Lord of life, 
 Who triumphed o'er the grave, 
 And rose victorious to the strife 
 For those He came to save. 
 His glories now we sing, 
 Who died, and rose on high, 
 Who died eternal life to bring, 
 And lives that death may die. 
 
 Crown Him the Lord of heaven, 
 One with the Father known, 
 One with the Spirit through Him giv'n 
 From yonder glorious throne. 
 To Thee be endless praise, 
 For Thou for us hast died; 
 Be Thou, O Lord, thru endless days 
 Adored and magnified.
