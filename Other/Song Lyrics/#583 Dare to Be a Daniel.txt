  Standing by a purpose true, 
 Heeding God's command, 
 Honour them, the faithful few! 
 All hail to Daniel's Band! 
 Dare to be a Daniel, 
 Dare to stand alone! 
 Dare to have a purpose firm! 
 Dare to make it known! 
 
 Many mighty men are lost, 
 Daring not to stand, 
 Who for God had been a host, 
 By joining Daniel's Band! 
 Dare to be a Daniel, 
 Dare to stand alone! 
 Dare to have a purpose firm! 
 Dare to make it known! 
 
 Many giants, great and tall, 
 Stalking thro' the land, 
 Headlong to the earth would fall, 
 If met by Daniel's Band! 
 Dare to be a Daniel, 
 Dare to stand alone! 
 Dare to have a purpose firm! 
 Dare to make it known! 
 
 Hold the gospel banner high! 
 On to vict'ry grand! 
 Satan and His host defy, 
 And shout for Daniel's Band! 
 Dare to be a Daniel, 
 Dare to stand alone! 
 Dare to have a purpose firm! 
 Dare to make it known!
