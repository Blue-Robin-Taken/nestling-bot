  I will sing the wondrous story Of the Christ who died for me, 
 How He left His home in glory For the cross of Calvary. 
 
  Refrain:
Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it in the light of glory,
Sing it through eternity.  
 
 I was lost, but Jesus found me, Found the sheep that went astray, 
 Threw His loving arms around me, Drew me back into His way. 
 
 I was bruised, but Jesus healed me; Faint was I from many a fall; 
 Sight was gone, and fears possessed me, But He freed me from them all. 
 
 Days of darkness still come o’er me, Sorrow’s paths I often tread, 
 But the Savior still is with me; By His hand I’m safely led. 
 
 He will keep me till the river, Rolls its waters at my feet; 
 Then He'll bear me safely over, Where the loved ones I shall meet.
