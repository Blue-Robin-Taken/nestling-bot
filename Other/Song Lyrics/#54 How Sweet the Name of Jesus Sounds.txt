 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds In a believer's ear! 
 It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, And drives away his fear. 
 
 It makes the wounded spirit whole And calms the troubled breast; 
 'Tis manna to the hungry soul, And to the weary rest. 
 
 Dear name! the Rock on which we build, Our shield and hiding-place; 
 Our never failing treasury, filled With boundless stores of grace. 
 
 Jesus, our Saviour, Shepherd, Friend, Our Prophet, Priest, and King; 
 Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End, Accept the praise we bring. 
 
 Weak is the effort of our heart, And cold our warmest thought; 
 But when we see Thee as Thou art, We'll praise Thee as we ought. 
 
 Till then we would Thy love proclaim With ev'ry fleeting breath; 
 And triumph in that blessed name Which quells the pow'r of death.
