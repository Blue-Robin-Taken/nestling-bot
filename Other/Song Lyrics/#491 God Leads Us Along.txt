  In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet, 
 God leads His dear children along; 
 Where the water's cool flow bathes the weary one's feet, 
 God leads His dear children along. 
 
  Refrain:  
 Some thru the waters, some thru the flood, 
 some thru the fire, but all thru the blood; 
 some thru great sorrow, but God gives a song, 
 in the night season and all the day long. 
 
 Sometimes on the mount where the sunshines so bright, 
 God leads His dear children along; 
 Sometimes in the valley, in the darkest of night, 
 God leads His dear children along. 
 
 Tho sorrows befall us and Satan oppose, 
 God leads His dear children along; 
 Thru grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes, 
 God leads His dear children along. 
 
 Away from the mire and away from the clay, 
 God leads His dear children along; 
 Away up in glory, eternity's day, 
 God leads His dear children along.
