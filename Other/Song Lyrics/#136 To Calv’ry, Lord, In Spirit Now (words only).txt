  To Calv’ry, Lord, in spirit now Our grateful souls repair, 
 To dwell upon Thy dying love, And taste its sweetness there. 
 
 Sweet resting-place of ev’ry heart That feels the plague of sin, 
 Yet knows the deep, mysterious joy Of peace with God within. 
 
 There, through Thine hour of deepest woe, Thy suff’ring spirit passed; 
 Grace there its wondrous vict’ry gained, And love endured its last. 
 
 O Lamb of God! Thy bleeding wounds, With cords of love divine, 
 Have drawn our willing hearts to Thee, And linked our life with Thine. 
 
 Our longing eyes would fain behold That bright and blessed brow, 
 Once wrung with bitterest anguish, wear Its crown of glory now. 
 
 Thy sympathies and hopes are ours: We long, O Lord, to see 
 Creation all – below, above, Redeemed and blessed by Thee.
