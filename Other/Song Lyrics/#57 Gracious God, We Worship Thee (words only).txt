  Gracious God, we worship Thee, Rev’rently we bow the knee; 
 Jesus Christ our only plea: Father, we adore Thee. 
 
 Vast Thy love – how deep, how wide – In the gift of Him who died; 
 Righteous claims all satisfied: Father, we adore Thee. 
 
 Low we bow before Thy face, Sons of God, O won-drous place! 
 Great the riches of Thy grace: Father, we adore Thee. 
 
 By Thy Spirit grant that we Worshippers in truth may be; 
 Praise, as incense, sweet to Thee: Father, we adore Thee. 
 
 Yet again our song we raise, Note of deep adoring praise; 
 Now – and soon through endless days: Father, we adore Thee.
