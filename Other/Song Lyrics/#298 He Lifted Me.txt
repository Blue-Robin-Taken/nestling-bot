 In lovingkindness Jesus came My soul in mercy to reclaim, 
 And from the depths of sin and shame Thru grace He lifted me. 
 
  Refrain:  
 From sinking sand He lifted me, 
 With tender hand He lifted me; 
 From shades of night to plains of light, 
 O praise His name, He lifted me! 
 
 He called me long before I heard, Before my sinful heart was stirred, 
 But when I took Him at His word, Forgiv'n He lifted me. 
 
 His brow was pierced with many a thorn, His hands by cruel nails was torn, 
 When from my guilt and grief, forlorn, In love He lifted me. 
 
 Now on a higher plane I dwell, And with my soul I know 'tis well; 
 Yet how or why, I cannot tell, He should have lifted me.
