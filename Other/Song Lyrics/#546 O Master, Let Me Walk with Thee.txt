  O Master, let me walk with Thee in lowly paths of service free; 
 Tell me Thy secret; help me bear The strain of toil, the fret of care. 
 
 Help me the slow of heart to move By some clear, winning word of love; 
 Teach me the wayward feet to stay, And guide them in the homeward way. 
 
 Teach me Thy patience! Still with Thee In closer, dearer company, 
 In work that keeps faith sweet and strong, In trust that triumphs over wrong. 
 
 In hope that sends a shining ray Far down the future's broad'ning way, 
 In peace that only Thou canst give, With Thee, O Master, let me live.
