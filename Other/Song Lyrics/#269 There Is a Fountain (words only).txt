  [Recording forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 There is a fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins; 
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood Lose all their guilty stains! 
 
  Refrain:
I do believe, I will believe, That Jesus died for me!
That on the cross He shed His blood, From sin to set me free.  
 
 E'er since by faith I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply, 
 Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die. 
 
 The dying thief rejoiced to see That fountain in his day; 
 And there may I, though vile as he, Wash all my sins away. 
 
 Dear dying Lamb! Thy precious blood Shall never lose its pow'r 
 Till all the ransomed church of God Be saved, to sin no more.
