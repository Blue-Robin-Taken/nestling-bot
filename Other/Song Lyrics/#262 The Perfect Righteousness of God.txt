 The perfect righteousness of God 
 Is witnessed in the Saviour's blood; 
 'Tis in the cross of Christ we trace 
 His righteousness, yet wondrous grace. 
 
 God could not pass the sinner by, 
 His sin demands that he must die; 
 But in the cross of Christ we see 
 How God can save us righteously. 
 
 The sin is on the Saviour laid, 
 'Tis in His blood sin's debt is paid; 
 Stern Justice can demand no more, 
 And Mercy can dispense her store. 
 
 The sinner who believes is free, 
 Can say: "The Saviour died for me;" 
 Can point to the atoning blood, 
 And say: "This made my peace with God."
