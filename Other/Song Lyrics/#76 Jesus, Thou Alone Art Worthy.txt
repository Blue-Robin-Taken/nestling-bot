 Jesus, Thou alone art worthy 
 Ceaseless praise to receive; 
 For Thy love and grace and goodness 
 Rise o'er all our thoughts conceive. 
 
 With adoring hearts, we render 
 Honor to Thy precious Name, 
 Overflowing with Thy mercies, 
 Far and wide Thy worth proclaim. 
 
 Praise Him! praise Him! praise the Savior! 
 Saints, aloud your voices raise - 
 Praise Him! praise Him! - 'till in heaven 
 Perfected we'll sing His praise.
