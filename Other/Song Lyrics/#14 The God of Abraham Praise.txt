  The God of Abraham praise, Who reigns enthroned above; 
 Ancient of everlasting days, And God of love. 
 Jehovah, great I AM, By earth and heaven confessed; 
 I bow and bless the sacred Name, Forever blest. 
 
 The God of Abraham praise, At whose supreme command 
 From earth I rise, and seek the joys At His right hand. 
 I all on earth forsake, Its wisdom, fame and power, 
 And Him my only portion make, My shield and tower. 
 
 He by Himself hath sworn, I on His oath depend, 
 I shall, on eagles' wings up-borne, To heaven ascend; 
 I shall behold His face, I shall His power adore, 
 And sing the wonders of His grace Forevermore. 
 
 The whole triumphant host Give thanks to God on high; 
 "Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!" They ever cry. 
 Hail, Abraham's God and mine! I join the heavenly lays; 
 All might and majesty are Thine, And endless praise
