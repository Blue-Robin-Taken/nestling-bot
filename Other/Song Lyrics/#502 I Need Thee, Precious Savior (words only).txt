  I need Thee, precious Savior! Oh, Thou art all to me; 
 Before the throne forever, I stand complete in Thee. 
 Though Satan loud accuses, Yet I can ever see, 
 The blood of Christ most precious, The sinner’s perfect plea. 
 
 I need Thee, precious Savior! For I am very poor; 
 A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store. 
 I need Thy love, Lord Jesus, To cheer me on the way, 
 To guide my doubting footsteps, To be my strength and stay. 
 
 I need Thee, precious Savior! I need a friend like Thee: 
 A friend to soothe and comfort, A friend to care for me; 
 I need Thy heart, Lord Jesus, To feel each anxious care; 
 To bear my ev’ry burden, And all my sorrow share. 
 
 I need Thee, precious Savior! I need Thee day by day, 
 To fill me with Thy fullness, To lead me on my way: 
 I need Thy Holy Spirit To teach me what I am – 
 To show me more of Jesus, To point me to the Lamb. 
 
 I need Thee, precious Savior! And hope to see Thee soon, 
 Encircled with the rainbow, And seated on Thy throne. 
 There, with Thy blood-bought people, My joy shall ever be, 
 To sing Thy praise, Lord Jesus, And ever gaze on Thee.
