  Call Jehovah thy salvation, Rest beneath the Almighty's shade, 
 In His secret habitation dwell and never be dismayed; 
 There no tumult shall alarm thee, thou shalt dread no hidden snare; 
 Guile nor violence can harm thee, in eternal safeguard there. 
 
 From the sword at noon-day wasting, from the noisome pestilence, 
 In the depth of midnight blasting, God shall be thy sure defense; 
 He shall charge His angel legions watch and ward o'er thee to keep; 
 Though thou walk through lonesome regions, Though in desert wilds thou sleep. 
 
 Since with pure and firm affection, thou on God hast set thy love, 
 With the wings of His protection He will shield thee from above; 
 Thou shalt call on Him in trouble, He will harken, He will save; 
 Here for grief reward thee double, crown with life beyond the grave.
