  There is never a day so dreary, 
 There is never a night so long, 
 But the soul that is trusting in Jesus 
 Will somewhere find a song. 
 
  Refrain:
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus,
In the heart He implanteth a song:
A song of deliverance, of courage, of strength,
In the heart He implanteth a song.  
 
 There is never a cross so heavy, 
 There is never a weight of woe, 
 But that Jesus will help to carry 
 Because He loveth so. 
 
 There is never a care or burden, 
 There is never a grief or loss, 
 But that Jesus in love will lighten 
 When carried to the cross. 
 
 There is never a guilty sinner, 
 There is never a wandering one, 
 But that God can in mercy pardon 
 Thro Jesus Christ, His Son.
