  Sinners Jesus will receive; 
 Sound this word of grace to all 
 Who the heav'nly pathway leave, 
 All who linger, all who fall. 
 
  Refrain:
Sing it o'er and o'er again;
Christ receiveth sinful men;
Make the message clear and plain:
Christ recieveth sinful men.  
 
 Come, and He will give you rest; 
 Trust Him, for His word is plain; 
 He will take the sinfulest; 
 Christ receiveth sinful men. 
 
 Now my heart condemns me not, 
 Pure before the law I stand; 
 He who cleansed me from all spot, 
 Satisfied its last demand. 
 
 Christ receiveth sinful men, 
 Even me with all my sin; 
 Purged from ev'ry spot and stain, 
 Heav'n with Him I enter in.
