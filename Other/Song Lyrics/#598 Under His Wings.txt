  Under His wings I am safely abiding; 
 Though the night deepens and tempests are wild, 
 Still I can trust Him, I know He will keep me; 
 He has redeemed me, and I am His child. 
 
 <i> REFRAIN:</i>  Under His wings, under His wings, 
 Who from His love can sever? 
 Under His wings my soul shall abide, 
 Safely abide forever. 
 
 Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow! 
 How the heart yearningly turns to His rest! 
 Often when earth has no balm for my healing, 
 There I find comfort, and there I am blest. 
 
 Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment! 
 There will I hide till life's trials are o'er; 
 Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me; 
 Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.
