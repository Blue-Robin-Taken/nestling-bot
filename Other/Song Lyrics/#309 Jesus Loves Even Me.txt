  I am so glad that our Father in heaven 
 Tells of His love in the Book He has given; 
 Wonderful things in the Bible I see - 
 This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me. 
 
  Refrain:
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.  
 
 Though I forget Him and wander away, 
 Still he doth love me wherever I stray; 
 Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, 
 When I remember that Jesus loves me. 
 
 Oh, if there's only one song I can sing, 
 When in His beauty I see the great King, 
 This shall my song in eternity be: 
 "Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!"
