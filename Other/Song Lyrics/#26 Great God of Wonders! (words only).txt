  Great God of wonders! all Thy ways Display Thine attributes divine; 
 But the bright glories of Thy grace Above Thine other wonders shine: 
 
  Refrain:
Who is a pard'ning God like Thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?
Who is a pard'ning God like Thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?  
 
 Such deep transgressions to forgive! Such guilty sinners thus to spare! 
 This is Thy grand prerogative, And in this honor none shall share. 
 
 Pardon, from an offended God! Pardon, for sins of deepest dye! 
 Pardon, bestowed through Jesus' blood! Pardon, that brings the rebel nigh!
