  Father, we worship Thee, Through Thy beloved Son; 
 And, by the Spirit, now draw near Before Thy holy throne. 
 
 We bless Thee Thou art Light, Righteous and true art Thou; 
 Holy and reverend Thy name, Our hearts before Thee bow. 
 
 We bless Thee Thou art Love, How vast that matchless grace, 
 Whose breadth and length and height and depth No finite mind can trace! 
 
 We bless Thee most of all For Him Who Thee unveiled; 
 Whose precious blood redemption wrought, And thus Thy heart revealed. 
 
 For what Thou art, we praise And worship and adore: 
 To Father, Son and Spirit be The glory evermore!
