  Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, 
 The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head; 
 The stars in the sky looked down where He lay - 
 The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay. 
 
 The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes, 
 But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes; 
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky, 
 And stay by my cradle, till morning is nigh. 
 
 Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay 
 Close by me forever, and love me, I pray; 
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care, 
 Prepare us for heaven to live with Thee there.
