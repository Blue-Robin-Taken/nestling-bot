  My glorious Victor, Prince divine, 
 Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine; 
 At length my will is all Thine own, 
 Glad vassal of a Saviour's throne. 
 
 My Master, lead me to Thy door; 
 Pierce this now willing ear once more; 
 Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay 
 With thee to toil, endure, obey. 
 
 Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will - 
 Use all in Thy dear slavery still! 
 Self's weary liberties I cast 
 Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast. 
 
 Tread them still down; and then, I know, 
 These hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow; 
 And pierced ears shall hear the tone 
 Which tells me Thou and I are one.
