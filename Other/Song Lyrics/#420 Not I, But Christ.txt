  Not I, but Christ be honored, loved, exalted, 
 Not I, but Christ be seen, be known, be heard; 
 Not I, but Christ in every look and action, 
 Not I, but Christ in every thought and word. 
 
  Refrain:
Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord,
Oh, to be lost in Thee,
Oh, that it may be no more I, But Christ that lives in me.  
 
 Not I, but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow, 
 Not I, but Christ to wipe the falling tear; 
 Not I, but Christ to lift the weary burden, 
 Not I, but Christ to hush away all fear. 
 
 Not I, but Christ, in lowly, silent labor; 
 Not I, but Christ, in humble, earnest toil; 
 Christ, only Christ! No show, no ostentation! 
 Christ, none but Christ, the gatherer of the spoil. 
 
 Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision, 
 Glory excelling, soon, full soon I'll see; 
 Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling, 
 Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.
