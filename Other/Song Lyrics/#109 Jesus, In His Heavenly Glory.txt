 Jesus, in His heavenly glory, 
 Sits with God upon the throne; 
 Now no more to be forsaken, 
 His humiliation gone. 
 
 Never more shall God, Jehovah, 
 Smite the Shepherd with the sword; 
 Ne'er again shall cruel sinners, 
 Set at nought our glorious Lord. 
 
 Dwelling in eternal sunshine 
 Of the countenance of God, 
 Jesus fills all heav'n with incense 
 Of His reconciling blood. 
 
 On His heart our names are graven, 
 On His shoulders we are borne; 
 Of our God beloved in Jesus, 
 We can love Him in return.
