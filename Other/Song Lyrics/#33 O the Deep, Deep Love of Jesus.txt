  O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
 Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free; 
 Rolling as a mighty ocean 
 In its fullness over me. 
 Underneath me, all around me, 
 Is the current of Thy love; 
 Leading onward, leading homeward 
 To my glorious rest above. 
 
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
 Spread His praise from shore to shore; 
 How He loveth, ever loveth, 
 Changeth never, never more; 
 How He watches o'er His loved ones, 
 Died to call them all His own; 
 How for them He intercedeth, 
 Watcheth o'er them from the throne. 
 
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
 Love of ev'ry love the best; 
 'Tis an ocean vast of blessing, 
 'Tis a haven sweet of rest, 
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
 'Tis a Heav'n of Heav'ns to me; 
 And it lifts me up to glory, 
 For it lifts me up to Thee.
