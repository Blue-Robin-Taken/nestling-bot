  Lord, speak to me, that I may speak 
 In living echoes of Thy tone; 
 As Thou hast sought, so let me seek 
 Thy erring children lost and lone. 
 
 O teach me, Lord, that I may teach 
 The precious things Thou dost impart; 
 And wing my words, that they may reach 
 The hidden depths of many a heart. 
 
 O fill me with Thy fullness, Lord, 
 Until my very heart o'erflow 
 In kindling thought and glowing word, 
 Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show. 
 
 O use me, Lord, use even me, 
 Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where; 
 Until Thy blessed face I see, 
 Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
