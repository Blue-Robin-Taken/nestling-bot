 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life, 
 When the clouds unfold their wings of strife? 
 When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain, 
 Will your anchor drift, or firm remain? 
 
  Refrain:
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love.  
 
 It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand, 
 For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand; 
 And the cables, passed form His heart to mine, 
 Can defy that blast, through strength divine. 
 
 It will firmly hold in the straits of fear, 
 When the breakers have told the reef is near; 
 Though the tempest rave and the wildwinds blow, 
 Not an angry wave shall our bark o'er flow. 
 
 When our eyes behold through the gathering night 
 The city of gold, our harbor bright, 
 We shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore, 
 With the storms all past forevermore.
