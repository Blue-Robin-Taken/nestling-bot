 Praise the Savior ye who know him! 
 Who can tell how much we owe him? 
 Gladly let us render to Him 
 All we are and have. 
 
 Jesus is the name that charms us; 
 He for conflict fits and arms us; 
 Nothing moves and nothing harms us 
 While we trust in Him. 
 
 Trust in Him, ye saints, forever; 
 He is faithful, changing never; 
 Neither force nor guile can sever 
 Those He loves from Him. 
 
 Keep us, Lord, O keep us cleaving 
 To Thyself and still believing, 
 Till the hour of our receiving 
 Promised joys with Thee. 
 
 Then we shall be where we would be, 
 When we shall be what we should be; 
 Things that are not now, nor could be, 
 Soon shall be our own.
