  Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus, In spirit here we stand, 
 With hearts all full of praises, To keep the blest command. 
 By faith our souls rejoicing To trace the path of love, 
 Through death’s dark angry billows Up to the throne above. 
 
 Lord Jesus, we remember the travail of Thy soul, 
 When in thy love's deep pity The waves did o’er Thee roll. 
 Baptized in death's cold waters For us Thy blood was shed, 
 For us Thou, Lord of glory Wast numbered with the dead. 
 
 O Lord, Thou now art risen, Thy travail all is o’er; 
 For sin Thou once hast suffered - Thou liv’st to die no more. 
 Sin, death, and hell, are vanquished By Thee, the Church's head; 
 And now we share Thy triumph, Thou Firstborn from the dead. 
 
 Unto Thy death baptized, We own with Thee we died; 
 With Thee, our Life, we’re risen: And shall be glorified. 
 From sin, the world, and Satan, We’re ransomed by Thy blood, 
 And here would walk as strangers, alive with Thee to God.
