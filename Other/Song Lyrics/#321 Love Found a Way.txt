  Wonderful love that rescued me, Sunk deep in sin, 
 Guilty and vile as I could be - No hope within; 
 When every ray of light had fled, O glorious day! 
 Raising my soul from out the dead, Love found a way. 
 
  Refrain:  
 Love found a way to redeem my soul, 
 Love found a way that could make me whole; 
 Love sent my Lord to the cross of shame, 
 Love found a way, O praise His holy name! 
 
 Love brought my Saviour here to die On Calvary, 
 For such a sinful wretch as I, How can it be? 
 Love bridged the gulf 'twixt me and heaven, Taught me to pray; 
 I am redeemed, set free, forgiv'n, Love found a way. 
 
 Love opened wide the gates of light To heaven's domain, 
 Where in eternal power and might Jesus shall reign; 
 Love lifted me from depths of woe To endless day, 
 There was no help in earth below, Love found a way.
