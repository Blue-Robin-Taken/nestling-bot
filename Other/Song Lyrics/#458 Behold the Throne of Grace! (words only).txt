  Behold the throne of grace! 
 The promise calls us near! 
 To seek our God and Father's face, 
 Who loves to answer prayer. 
 
 That rich atoning blood, 
 Which sprinkled ‘round we see, 
 Provides for those who come to God 
 An all-prevailing plea. 
 
 My soul, ask what thou wilt, 
 Thou canst not be too bold: 
 Since His own blood for thee was spilt, 
 What else can He withhold? 
 
 Beyond our utmost wants 
 His love and power can bless: 
 To praying souls He always grants 
 More than they can express. 
 
 Since ‘tis the Lord's command, 
 Our mouth we’ll open wide: 
 Lord, open Thou Thy bounteous hand, 
 That we may be supplied. 
 
 Thine image Lord, bestow, 
 Thy presence and Thy love: 
 We ask to serve Thee here below, 
 And reign with Thee above.
