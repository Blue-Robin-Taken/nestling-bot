  Out in the highways and byways of life, 
 Many are weary and sad; (are weary and sad;) 
 Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife, 
 Making the sorrow glad. 
 
  Refrain:
Make me a blessing, Make me a blessing,
Out of my life (Out of my life) may Jesus shine;
Make me a blessing O Saviour, I pray, (I pray Thee, My Saviour)
Make me a blessing to someone today.  
 
 Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love, 
 Tell of His power to forgive; (His power to forgive;) 
 Others will trust Him if only you prove 
 True, every moment you live. 
 
 Give as 'twas given to you in your need, 
 Love as the Master loved you; (the Master loved you;) 
 Be to the helpless a helper indeed, 
 Unto your mission be true.
