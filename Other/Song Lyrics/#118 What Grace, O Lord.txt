 What grace, O Lord, and beauty shone 
 Around Thy steps below! 
 What patient love was seen in all 
 Thy life and death of woe! 
 
 Forever on Thy burdened heart 
 A weight of sorrow hung; 
 Yet no ungentle murm'ring word 
 Escaped Thy silent tongue. 
 
 Thy foes might hate, despise, revile - 
 Thy firends unfaithful prove; 
 Unwearied in forgiveness still, 
 Thy heart could only love. 
 
 Oh, give us hearts to love like Thee - 
 Like Thee, O Lord, to grieve 
 Far more for other's sins than all 
 The wrongs that we receive. 
 
 One with Thyself, may ev'ry eye 
 In us, Thy brethren, see 
 That gentleness and grace that spring 
 From union, Lord, with Thee.
