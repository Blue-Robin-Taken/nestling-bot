 I will sing of my Redeemer, 
 And His wondrous love to me; 
 On the cruel cross He suffered, 
 From the curse to set me free. 
 
  Refrain
Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
(TB) of my Redeemer, Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
(TB) He purchased me, with His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
(TB) He sealed my pardon, on the cross He sealed my pardon
Paid the debt, and made me free.
(TB) and made me free, and made me free.  
 
 I will tell the wondrous story, 
 How my lost estate to save, 
 In His boundless love and mercy, 
 He the ransom freely gave. 
 
 I will praise my dear Redeemer, 
 His triumphant power I'll tell, 
 How the victory He giveth 
 Over sin and death and hell. 
 
 I will sing of my Redeemer, 
 And His heavenly love to me; 
 He from death to life hath brought me, 
 Son of God, with Him to be.
