  Beautiful words of Jesus, Spoken so long ago; 
 Yet, as we sing them over, Dearer to us they grow; 
 Calling the heavy laden, Calling to hearts oppressed: 
 Come unto Me, ye weary, Come, I will give you rest. 
 
  Refrain:
Hear the call of of His voice so sweet;
Bring your load to to the Saviorï¿½s feet;
Lean your heart on on His loving breast,
Come, O come, and He will come, and He will give you rest.  
 
 Beautiful words of Jesus, Cheering us day by day; 
 Throwing a gleam of sunshine Over a cloudy way; 
 Casting on Him the burden We are too weak to bear, 
 He will give grace sufficient, He will regard our prayer. 
 
 Beautiful words of Jesus, Tokens of endless rest, 
 When, by and by, we enter Into His presence blest; 
 There shall we see His beauty, Meet with Him face to face; 
 There shall we sing His glory, Praising His matchless grace.
