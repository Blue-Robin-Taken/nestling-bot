 Take my life, and let it be 
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee; 
 Take my hands, and let them move 
 At the impulse of Thy love, 
 At the impulse of Thy love. 
 
 Take my feet, and let them be 
 Swift and beautiful for Thee; 
 Take my voice, and let me sing 
 Always, only, for my King, 
 Always, only, for my King. 
 
 Take my lips, and let them be 
 Filled with messages from Thee; 
 Take my silver and my gold; 
 Not a mite would I withhold, 
 Not a mite would I withhold. 
 
 Take my love, my God, I pour 
 At Thy feet its treasure store; 
 Take myself, and I will be 
 Ever, only, all for Thee, 
 Ever, only, all for Thee.
