 Rise my soul! Behold 'tis Jesus, Jesus fills Thy wondering eyes; 
 See Him now in glory seated, where thy sins no more can rise. 
 
 There, in righteousness transcendent, Lo! He doth in heav'n appear, 
 Shows the blood of His atonement as they title to be there. 
 
 All thy sins were laid upon Him, Jesus bore them on the tree; 
 God, who knew them, laid them on Him, and, believing, thou art free. 
 
 God now brings thee to His dwelling, spreads for thee His feast divine, 
 Bids thee welcome, ever telling what a portion there is thine. 
 
 In that circle of God's favor, circle of the Father's love, 
 All is rest, and rest forever, all is perfectness above. 
 
 Blessed, glorious word "forever!" Yea, "forever!" is the word; 
 Nothing can the ransomed sever, naught divide them from the Lord.
