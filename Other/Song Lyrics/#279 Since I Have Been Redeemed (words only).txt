  [Recording forthcoming, Lord willing] 
 
 I have a song I love to sing, Since I have been redeemed, 
 Of my Redeemer, Savior, King, Since I have been redeemed. 
 
  Refrain:
Since I have been redeemed,
Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in His name;
Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior's name.  
 
 I have a Christ who satisfies, Since I have been redeemed; 
 To do His will my highest prize, Since I have been redeemed. 
 
 I have a witness bright and clear, Since I have been redeemed, 
 Dispelling every doubt and fear, Since I have been redeemed. 
 
 I have a home prepared for me, Since I have been redeemed, 
 Where I shall dwell eternally, Since I have been redeemed.
