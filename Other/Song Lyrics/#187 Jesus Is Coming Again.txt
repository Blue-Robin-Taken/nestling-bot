  Marvellous message we bring, Glorious carol we sing, 
 Wonderful word of the King - Jesus is coming again! (again!) 
 
  Refrain:
Coming again, Coming again;
May be morning, may be soon,
May be evening and may be soon!
Coming again, Coming again;
O what a wonderful day it will be -
Jesus is coming again!  
 
 Forest and flower exclaim, Mountain and meadow the same, 
 All earth and heaven proclaim - Jesus is coming again! (again!) 
 
 Standing before Him at last, Trial and trouble all past, 
 Crowns at His feet we will cast - Jesus is coming again! (again!)
