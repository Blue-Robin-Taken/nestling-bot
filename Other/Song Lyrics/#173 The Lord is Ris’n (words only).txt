  The Lord is ris’n; and death’s dark judgment flood 
 Is passed, in Him who bought us with His blood. 
 The Lord is ris’n: we stand beyond the doom 
 Of all our sin, through Jesus’ empty tomb. 
 
 The Lord is ris’n: with Him we also rose, 
 And in His grave see vanquished all our foes. 
 The Lord is ris’n: beyond the judgment land, 
 In Him, in resurrection-life we stand. 
 
 The Lord is ris’n; and now redeemed to God, 
 We tread the desert which His feet have trod. 
 The Lord is ris’n: the sanctu’ry’s our place, 
 Where now we dwell before the Father’s face. 
 
 The Lord is ris’n: the Lord has gone before. 
 We long to see Him, and to sin no more. 
 The Lord is ris’n: our triumph shout shall be, – 
 “Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord are free!"
