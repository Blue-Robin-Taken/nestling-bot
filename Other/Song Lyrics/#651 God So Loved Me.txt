 God so loved me that He gave His own blessed Son; 
 There is no one else can save: Jesus is the One. 
 
  Refrain:
Still my heart must opened be, and the Saviour I must see;
Must believe He died for me, me, a little child.  
 
 Though I try hard every day to be good and kind; 
 Though I learn nice prayers to say, And my parents mind. 
 
 I may never stay away from the Sunday School; 
 I may always, when at play, use the "Golden Rule." 
 
 I may often learn a verse from God's holy Book; 
 Know about the sin and curse that the Saviour took. 
 
 Though I may not lie or steal, and am well behaved; 
 As a sinner I must know that I must be saved. 
 
  Final Refrain:
Then my heart will opened be, and the Saviour I shall see;
Will believe He died for me, me, a little child.
