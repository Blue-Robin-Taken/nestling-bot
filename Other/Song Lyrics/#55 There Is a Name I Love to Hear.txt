 There is a name I love to hear, 
 I love to speak its worth; 
 It sounds like music in mine ear, 
 The sweetest Name on earth. 
 
 It tells me of a Saviour's love, 
 Who died to set me free; 
 It tells me of His precious blood, 
 The sinner's perfect plea. 
 
 Jesus! the name I love so well, 
 The name I love to hear; 
 No saint on earth its worth can tell, 
 No heart conceive how dear. 
 
 This name shall shed its fragrance still 
 Along life's thorny road, 
 Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill 
 That leads me up to God. 
 
 And there, with all the blood-bought throng, 
 From sin and sorrow free, 
 I'll sing the new, eternal song 
 Of Jesus' love to me.
