 Down to the depths of woe 
 Christ came to set me free: 
 He bared His breast, received the blow, 
 Which Justice aimed at me! 
 
 There Justice met my sin, 
 On the accursed tree: 
 To prove His love, my heart to win, 
 Christ "gave Himself for me!" 
 
 As Advocate on high, 
 My soul, He pleads for thee! 
 And when I wander, draws me nigh - 
 He ever lives for me! 
 
 Through all this desert place, 
 My Guide and Strength is He, 
 Till I shall see Him face to face, 
 When He shall come for me! 
 
 Yes! soon this waiting hour 
 On time's swift wing shall flee: 
 Soon He will come in glorious power - 
 Jesus Himself for me!
