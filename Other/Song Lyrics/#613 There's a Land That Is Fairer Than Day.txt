  There's a land that is fairer than day, 
 Any by faith we can see it afar; 
 For the Father waits over the way 
 To prepare us a dwelling place there. 
 
  Refrain:
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.  
 
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
 The melodious songs of the blest, 
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more, 
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. 
 
 To our bountiful Father above, 
 We will offer the tribute of praise 
 For the glorious gift of His love 
 And the blessings that hallow our days.
