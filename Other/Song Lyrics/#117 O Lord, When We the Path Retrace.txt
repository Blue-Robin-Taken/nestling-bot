 O Lord, when we the path retrace 
 Which Thou on earth hast trod, 
 To man Thy wondrous love and grace, 
 Thy faithfulness to God; 
 
 Thy love, by man so sorely tried, 
 Proved stronger than the grave; 
 The very spear that pierced Thy side 
 Drew forth the blood to save; 
 
 Faithful amidst unfaithfulness, 
 'Mid darkness only light, 
 Thou didst Thy Father's name confess, 
 And in His will delight; 
 
 Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles, 
 Or suffering shame and loss, 
 Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles, 
 Led only to the cross: 
 
 We wonder at Thy lowly mind, 
 And fain would like Thee be, 
 And all our rest and pleasure find 
 In learning, Lord, of Thee.
