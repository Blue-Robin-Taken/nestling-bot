 Put thou thy trust in God, 
 In duty's path go on; 
 Walk in His strength with faith and hope, 
 So shall thy work be done. 
 
 Commit thy ways to Him, 
 Thy works into His hands, 
 And rest on His unchanging word, 
 Who heaven and earth commands. 
 
 Though years on years roll on, 
 His covenant shall endure; 
 Though clouds and darkness hide His path, 
 The promised grace is sure. 
 
 Through waves, and clouds, and storms 
 His power will clear the way; 
 Wait thou His time, the darkest night 
 Shall end in brightest day. 
 
 Leave to His sov'reign sway 
 To choose and to command; 
 So shalt thou, wond'ring, own His way 
 How wise, how strong His hand.
