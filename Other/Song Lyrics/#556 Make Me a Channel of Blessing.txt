  Is your life a channel of blessing? 
 Is the love of God flowing through you? 
 Are you telling the lost of the Saviour? 
 Are you ready His service to do? 
 
  Refrain:
Make me a channel of blessing today,
Make me a channel of blessing I pray;
My life possessing, my service blessing,
Make me a channel of blessing today.  
 
 Is your life a channel of blessing? 
 Are you burdened for those who are lost? 
 Have you urged upon those who are straying 
 The Saviour who died on the cross? 
 
 Is your life a channel of blessing? 
 Is it daily telling for Him? 
 Have you spoken the word of salvation 
 To those who are dying in sin? 
 
 We cannot be channels of blessing 
 If our lives are not free from known sin; 
 We will barriers be and a hindrance 
 To those we are trying to win.
