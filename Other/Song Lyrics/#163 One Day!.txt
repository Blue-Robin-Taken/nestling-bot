  One day when heaven was filled with His praises, 
 One day when sin was as black as could be, 
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin, 
 Dwelt among men, my example is He! 
 
  Refrain:
Living, He loved me;
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
One day He's coming - oh, glorious day!  
 
 One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain, 
 One day they nailed Him to die on the tree; 
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected, 
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He! 
 
 One day they left Him alone in the garden, 
 One day He rested, from suffering free; 
 Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil; 
 Hope of the hopeless, my Saviour is He! 
 
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer, 
 One day the stone rolled away from the door; 
 Then He arose over death He has conquered; 
 Now is ascended, my Lord evermore! 
 
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming, 
 One day the skies with His glory will shine; 
 Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing; 
 Glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!
