  Gazing on the Lord in glory, 
 While our hearts in worship bow, 
 There we read the wondrous story 
 Of the cross, its shame and woe. 
 
 Every mark of dark dishonor 
 Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow 
 All the depths of Thy heart's sorrow, 
 Told in answering glory now! 
 
 On that cross, alone, forsaken, 
 Where no pitying eye was found; 
 Now, to God's right hand exalted, 
 With Thy praise the heavens resound! 
 
 Did Thy God even then forsake Thee, 
 Hide His face from Thy deep need? 
 In Thy face, once marred and smitten, 
 All His glory now we read. 
 
 Gazing on it we adore Thee, 
 Blessed, precious, holy Lord! 
 Thou, the Lamb, alone, art worthy - 
 This be earth's and heaven's accord. 
 
 Rise our hearts, and bless the Father, 
 Ceaseless song even here begun; 
 Endless praise and adoration 
 To the Father and the Son!
