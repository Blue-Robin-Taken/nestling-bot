  Up Calv'rys mountain, one dreadful morn, 
 Walked Christ my Saviour, weary and worn; 
 Facing for sinners death on the cross, 
 That He might save them from endless loss. 
 
  Refrain:  
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer! 
 Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree, 
 Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading- 
 Blind and unheeding - dying for me! 
 
 "Father, forgive them!" thus did He pray, 
 E'en while His life-blood flowed fast away; 
 Praying for sinners while in such woe- 
 No one but Jesus ever loved so. 
 
 O how I love Him, Saviour and Friend! 
 How can my praises ever find end! 
 Thru years unnumbered on heaven's shore, 
 My tongue shall praise Him forever more.
