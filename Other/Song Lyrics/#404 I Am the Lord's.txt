 I am the Lord's! O Joy beyond expression, 
 O sweet response to voice of love Divine; 
 Faith's joyous "Yes" to the assuring whisper, 
 "Fear not! I have redeemed thee; thou art Mine." 
 
 I am the Lord's! It is the glad confession, 
 Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day, 
 When love's "I will" accepted Him forever, 
 "The Lord's," to love, to honor and obey. 
 
 I am the Lord's! Yet teach me all it meaneth, 
 All it involves of love and loyalty. 
 Of holy service, absolute surrender, 
 And unreserved obedience unto Thee. 
 
 I am the Lord's! Yes; body, soul, and spirit, 
 O seal them irrecoverably Thine; 
 As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fullness 
 Forever and forevermore art mine.
