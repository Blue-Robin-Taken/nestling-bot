 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart - 
 Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art; 
 Thou my best thought, by day or by night - 
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. 
 
 Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word - 
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord; 
 Thou my great Father, I Thy true son - 
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. 
 
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise - 
 Thou mine Inheritance, now and always: 
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart - 
 High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art. 
 
 High King of heaven, my victory won, 
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun! 
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, 
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
