  Savior, come, Thy saints are waiting, Waiting for the advent day, 
 Thence their promised glory dating; Come, and bear Thy saints away. 
 Come, Lord Jesus, come, Lord Jesus, 
 Thus Thy waiting people pray. 
 
 Lord, we wait for Thine appearing; "Even so," Thy people say; 
 Bright the prospect is, and cheering, Of beholding Thee that day; 
 When our sorrow, when our sorrow 
 Shall forever pass away. 
 
 Till it comes, O keep us steady! Keep us walking in Thy ways; 
 At Thy call may we be ready, On Thee, Lord, with joy to gaze; 
 And in heaven, and in heaven 
 Sing Thine everlasting praise.
