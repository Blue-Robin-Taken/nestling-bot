  How I praise Thee, precious Savior, 
 That Thy love laid hold of me; 
 Thou has saved and cleansed and filled me 
 That I might Thy channel be. 
 
  Refrain:
Channels only, blessed Master--
But with all Thy wondrous pow'r
Flowing thru us, Thou canst use us
Every day and every hour.  
 
 Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me, 
 A clean vessel in Thy hand, 
 With no pow'r but as Thou givest 
 Graciously with each command. 
 
 Witnessing Thy power to save me, 
 Setting free from self and sin; 
 Thou who boughtest to possess me, 
 In Thy fulness Lord come in. 
 
 Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit 
 Hearts that full surrender know, 
 That the streams of living water 
 From our inner man may flow.
