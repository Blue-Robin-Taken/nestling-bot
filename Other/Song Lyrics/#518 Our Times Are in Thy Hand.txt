 Our times are in thy hand; 
 Father, we wish them there! 
 Our life, our souls, our all we leave 
 Entirely to Thy care. 
 
 Our times are in thy hand, 
 Whatever they may be; 
 Pleasing or painful, dark or bright, 
 As best may seem to Thee. 
 
 Our times are in thy hand; 
 Why should we doubt or fear? 
 Our Father's hand will never cause 
 His child a needless tear. 
 
 Our times are in thy hand, 
 Jesus the crucified! 
 The hand our many sins have pierced 
 Is now our guard and guide. 
 
 Our times are in thy hand, 
 Oh Lord, our Advocate! 
 Nor is that hand outstretched in vain, 
 For us to supplicate. 
 
 [Additional Verse] 
 Our times are in thy hand, 
 What joy that time shall be - 
 When our Beloved's lovely face 
 At last our eyes shall see!
