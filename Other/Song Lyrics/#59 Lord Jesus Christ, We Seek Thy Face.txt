  Lord Jesus Christ, we seek Thy face; 
 Within the veil we bow the knee; 
 Oh, let Thy glory fill the place, 
 And bless us while we wait on Thee. 
 
 We thank Thee for the precious blood 
 That purged our sins and brought us nigh; 
 All cleansed and sanctified to God, 
 Thy holy name to magnify. 
 
 Shut in with Thee far, far above 
 The restless world that wars below; 
 We seek to learn and prove Thy love, 
 Thy wisdom and Thy grace to know. 
 
 The brow that once with thorns was bound, 
 Thy hands, Thy side, we fain would see; 
 Draw near, Lord Jesus; glory crowned, 
 And bless us while we wait on Thee.
