  Not now, but in the coming years, 
 It may be in the better land, 
 We'll read the meaning of our tears, 
 And there, some time we'll understand. 
 
  Refrain:
Then trust in God thro' all thy days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Some time, some time, we'll understand.  
 
 We'll catch the broken thread again, 
 And finish what we here began; 
 Heav'n will the mysteries explain, 
 And then, ah, then, we'll understand. 
 
 We'll know why clouds instead of sun 
 Were over many a cherished plan; 
 Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
 'Tis there, some time, we'll understand. 
 
 God knows the way, He holds the key, 
 He guides us with unerring hand; 
 Some time with tearless eyes we'll see; 
 Yes, there, up there, we'll understand.
