  Oh, for a heart to praise my God, 
 A heart from sin set free; 
 A heart that's trusting in the blood 
 So freely shed for me. 
 
 A heart resigned, submissive, meek, 
 My dear Redeemer's throne; 
 Where only Christ is heard to speak, 
 Where Jesus reigns alone. 
 
 A humble, lowly, contrite heart, 
 Believing, true, and clean, 
 Which neither death nor life can part 
 From Him that dwells within 
 
 A heart in every thought renewed, 
 And filled with love divine; 
 Perfect and right, and pure and good 
 A copy, Lord of Thine.
