 Who is He born in yonder stall, at whose feet the shepherds fall?
 Who is He in deep distress, fasting in the wilderness?

 Refrain:
 'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story!
 'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
 At His feet we humbly fall,
 crown Him, crown Him, Lord of all!

 Who is He the people bless for His words of gentleness?
 Who is He to whom they bring all the sick and sorrowing?

 Who is He that stands and weeps at the grave where Lazarus sleeps?
 Who is He the gath'ring throng greet with loud triumphant song?

 Lo! at midnight, who is He prays in dark Gethsemane?
 Who is He on yonder tree dies in grief and agony?

 Who is He that from the grave comes to succour, help and save?
 Who is He that from His throne rules thro' all the world alone?
