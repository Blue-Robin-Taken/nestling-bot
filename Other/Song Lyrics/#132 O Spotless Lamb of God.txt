 O spotless Lamb of God, in Thee 
 The Father's holiness we see; 
 And with delight Thy children trace, 
 In Thee, His wondrous love and grace. 
 
 For Thou didst leave Thy throne above 
 To teach us that our God is Love; 
 And now we see His glory shine 
 In every word and deed of Thine. 
 
 When we behold Thee, Lamb of God, 
 Beneath our sin's tremendous load; 
 Expiring on the accursed tree, 
 How great our guilt, with grief we see. 
 
 There we with joy Thy grace behold; 
 It's height and depth can ne'er be told! 
 It bursts our chains and sets us free, 
 And sweetly draws our souls to Thee. 
 
 The cross reveals Thy love below; 
 But better soon our hearts shall know, 
 When we behold Thy face above, 
 The fulness of our Father's love.
