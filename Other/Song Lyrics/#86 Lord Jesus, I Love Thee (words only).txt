  Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, 
 My Rock and my Fortress, my Surety divine, 
 My gracious Redeemer, my song shall be now: 
 ’Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou. 
 
 I love Thee because that hast first loved me 
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree; 
 I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow: 
 ’Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou. 
 
 I’d love Thee in life, I would love Thee in death, 
 And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath, 
 And sing, should the death-dew lie cold on my brow: 
 ’Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou. 
 
 And when the bright morn of Thy glory shall come, 
 And children ascend to the Father’s glad home, 
 I’ll shout, with Thy likeness impressed on my brow, 
 ’Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou. 
 
 [Added verse under #88 in HWR] 
 Lord Jesus we worship and bow at Thy feet, 
 And give Thee the glory, the honor that’s meet. 
 While through Thee, O Savior, our praises ascend 
 And join in the chorus that never shall end.
