 My Redeemer, oh, what beauties In that lovely name appear; 
 None but Jesus in His glories Shall the honored title wear. 
 My Redeemer, my Redeemer, Thou hast my salvation wrought. 
 
 Sunk in ruin, sin, and mis'ry, Bounded by Satan's captive chain, 
 Guided by his artful treach'ry, Hurring on to endless pain, 
 My Redeemer, my Redeemer, Plucked me as a brand from hell. 
 
 Mine by cov'nant, mine forever, Mine by oath and mine by blood. 
 Mine - nor time the bond shall sever, Mine as an unchanging God. 
 My Redeemer,my Redeemer, Oh, how sweet to call Thee Mine! 
 
 When in heav'n I see Thy glory, When before Thy throne I bow, 
 Perfected I shall be like Thee, Fully Thy redemption know. 
 My Redeemer, my Redeemer, Then shall hear me shout His praise.
