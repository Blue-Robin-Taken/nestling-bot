  From Jesse’s stock upspringing, On tender root has grown: 
 A rose by Prophet’s singing To all the world made known. 
 The rose ’midst winter’s cold, 
 A lovely blossom bearing, In former days foretold. 
 
 This rose then of my story Isaiah did proclaim. 
 What God ordained in glory By blessèd Mary came. 
 The Child the virgin bore, 
 The world’s salvation bringing Through Him forevermore. 
 
 The rosebud small and tender Gives fragrance every day. 
 And by its brilliant splendor Makes darkness pass away. 
 True Man, yet very God, 
 From sin and death He saves us And lightens every load. 
 
 Since all He comes to ransom, By all be He adored; 
 The Infant born in Bethle’m, The Savior and the Lord. 
 Repeat the hymn again; 
 “To God on high be glory, And peace on earth to men!”
