  Once far from God and dead in sin, 
 No light my heart could see; 
 But in God's Word the light I found, 
 Now Christ liveth in me. 
 
  Refrain:  
 Christ liveth in me, 
 Christ liveth in me, 
 Oh!what a salvation this, 
 That Christ liveth in me. 
 
 As rays of light from yonder sun, 
 The flow'rs of earth set free, 
 So life and light and love came forth 
 From Christ living in me. 
 
 As lives the flow'r within the seed, 
 As in the cone the tree, 
 So, praise the God of truth and grace, 
 His Spirit dwelleth in me. 
 
 With longing all my heart is filled, 
 That like Him I may be, 
 As on the wondrous thought I dwell 
 That Christ liveth in me.
