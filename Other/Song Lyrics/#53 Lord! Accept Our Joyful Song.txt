  Lord! accept our joyful song; Power and praise to Thee belong; 
 We would all Thy grace record, Holy, holy, holy Lord! 
 
 Rich in glory, Thou did'st stoop, Thence is all Thy people's hope; 
 Thou wast poor, that we might be Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee! 
 
 When we think of love like this, Joy and shame our hearts possess; 
 Joy, that Thou could'st pity thus, Shame, for such returns from us. 
 
 Yet we soon the day shall see, When we shall from sin be free: 
 When, to Thee in glory brought, We shall serve Thee as we ought.
