 With harps and viols, there stands a great throng 
 In the presence of Jesus, and sings this new song: 
 
  Refrain:
Unto Him who hath loved us and washed us from sin,
Unto Him be the glory for ever. Amen.  
 
 All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight, 
 Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite: 
 
 He maketh the rebel a priest and a king, 
 He hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing: 
 
 How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been, 
 If He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin: 
 
 Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring, 
 So that others believing, this new song shall sing:
