 What a fellowship, what a joy divine, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms; 
 What a blessedness, what a peace is mine, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms. 
 
  Refrain:
Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, Leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.  
 
 Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms; 
 Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms. 
 
 What have I to dread, what have I to fear, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms; 
 I have blessed peace with my Lord so near, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.
