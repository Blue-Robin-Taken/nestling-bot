  Blessed be God, our God, 
 Who gave for us His well-beloved Son, 
 The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one; 
 Blessed be God, our God! 
 
 What will He not bestow! 
 Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought, 
 Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought, 
 What will He not bestow? 
 
 He spared not His Son! 
 'Tis this that silences each rising fear, 
 'Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear; 
 He spared not His Son! 
 
 Who shall condemn us now? 
 Since Christ has died, and risen, and gone above, 
 For us to plead at the right hand of Love, 
 Who shall condemn us now? 
 
 'Tis God that justifies! 
 Who shall recall His pardon or His grace? 
 Or who the broken chain of guilt replace? 
 'Tis God that justifies! 
 
 The victory is ours! 
 For us in might came forth the mighty One; 
 For us He fought the fight, the triumph won: 
 The victory is ours!
