  Blessed it is when Christians sleep, 
 They are with Christ whom they adore; 
 Why then should we in anguish weep? 
 They are not lost - but gone before. 
 
 Relieved from every mortal care, 
 By sin and sorrow vexed no more. 
 Eternal happiness they share; 
 They are with Christ - just gone before. 
 
 They wait for us in courts above, 
 Where saints all meet to part no more. 
 Embraced are they in arms of love, 
 They are with Christ - whom they adore. 
 
 Soon, soon, our blessed Lord will come, 
 And we shall meet those gone before. 
 We then shall find in that blest home, 
 They've been with Christ - whom they adore
