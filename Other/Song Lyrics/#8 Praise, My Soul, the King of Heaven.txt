  Praise, my soul, the King of heaven, To his feet thy tribute bring; 
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who, like me, His praise should sing? 
 Alleluia! Alleluia!Praise the Everlasting King! 
 
 Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress; 
 Praise Him, still the same forever, Slow to chide, and swift to bless. 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Glorious in His faithfulness! 
 
 Father-like, He tends and spares us; Well our feeble frame he knows, 
 In His hand He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes. 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Widely as His mercy flows! 
 
 Angels, help us to adore him, ye behold Him face to face; 
 Sun and moon, bow down before Him; dwellers all in time and space, 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise with us the God of grace!
