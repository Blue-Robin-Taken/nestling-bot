  Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia! 
 Sons of men and angels say: Alleluia! 
 Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia! 
 Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Alleluia! 
 
 Love's redeeming work is done, Alleluia! 
 Fought the fight, the battle won; Alleluia! 
 Death in vain forbids Him rise; Alleluia! 
 Christ has opened Paradise. Alleluia! 
 
 Lives again our glorious King; Alleluia! 
 Where, O death, is now they sting? Alleluia! 
 Dying once, He all doth save: Alleluia! 
 Where thy victory, O grave? Alleluia! 
 
 Soar we now where Christ has led, Alleluia! 
 Following our exalted Head; Alleluia! 
 Made like Him, like Him we rise; Alleluia! 
 Ours the cross, the grave, the skies. Alleluia!
