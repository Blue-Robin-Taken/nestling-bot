  O the bitter shame and sorrow! 
 That a time could ever be 
 When I let the Saviour's pity 
 Plead in vain; and proudly answered, 
 All of self, and none of Thee! 
 
 Yet He found me: I beheld Him 
 Bleeding on the accursed tree: 
 Heard Him pray: Forgive them, Father! 
 And my wistful heart said faintly, 
 Some of self, and some of Thee! 
 
 Day by day His tender mercy, 
 Healing, helping, full and free: 
 Sweet and strong, and ah! so patient, 
 Brought me lower, while I whispered, 
 Less of self, and more of Thee! 
 
 Higher than the highest heaven, 
 Deeper than the deepest sea, 
 Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered, 
 Grant me now my supplication - 
 None of self, and all of Thee!
